      <Text>Rizal’s First Poem</Text>
      <Text>“Sa Aking Mga Kababata” “To My Fellow Children”</Text>
      <Text>
        Whenever people of a country truly love The language which by heav'n
        they were taught to use That country also surely liberty pursue As does
        the bird which soars to freer space above. For language is the final
        judge and referee Upon the people in the land where it holds sway; In
        truth our human race resembles in this way The other living beings born
        in liberty. Whoever knows not how to love his native tongue Is worse
        than any best or evil smelling fish.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        To make our language richer ought to be our wish The same as any mother
        loves to feed her young. Tagalog and the Latin language are the same And
        English and Castilian and the angels' tongue; And God, whose watchful
        care o'er all is flung, Has given us His blessing in the speech we
        claim, Our mother tongue, like all the highest that we know Had alphabet
        and letters of its very own; But these were lost -- by furious waves
        were overthrown Like banca’s in the stormy sea, long years ago.
