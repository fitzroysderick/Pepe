          Whenever people of a country truly love The language which by heav'n
          they were taught to use That country also surely liberty pursue As
          does the bird which soars to freer space above. For language is the
          final judge and referee Upon the people in the land where it holds
          sway; In truth our human race resembles in this way The other living
          beings born in liberty. Whoever knows not how to love his native
          tongue Is worse than any best or evil smelling fish.

          To make our language richer ought to be our wish The same as any
          mother loves to feed her young. Tagalog and the Latin language are the
          same And English and Castilian and the angels' tongue; And God, whose
          watchful care o'er all is flung, Has given us His blessing in the
          speech we claim, Our mother tongue, like all the highest that we know
          Had alphabet and letters of its very own; But these were lost -- by
          furious waves were overthrown Like banca’s in the stormy sea, long
          years ago.
