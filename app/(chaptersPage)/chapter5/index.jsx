      <Text>Influences of Rizal’s Formal Education</Text>

      <Text>
        Jose Rizal’s first teacher was his mother, who had taught him how to
        read and pray and who had encouraged him to write poetry. Later, private
        tutors taught the young Rizal Spanish and Latin, before he was sent to a
        private school in Biñan.
      </Text>

      <Text>
        When he was 11 years old, Rizal entered the Ateneo Municipal de Manila.
        He earned excellent marks in subjects like philosophy, physics,
        chemistry, and natural history. At this school, he read novels; wrote
        prize-winning poetry (and even a melodrama—“Junto al Pasig”); and
        practiced drawing, painting, and clay modeling, all of which remained
        lifelong interests for him.
      </Text>

      <Text>
        Rizal eventually earned a land surveyor’s and assessor’s degree from the
        Ateneo Municipal while taking up Philosophy and Letters at the
        University of Santo Tomas. Upon learning that his mother was going
        blind, Rizal opted to study ophthalmology at the UST Faculty of Medicine
        and Surgery. He, however, was not able to complete the course because
        “he became politically isolated by adversaries among the faculty and
        clergy who demanded that he assimilate to their system.”
      </Text>

      <Text>
        Without the knowledge of his parents, Rizal traveled to Europe in May
        1882. According to his biographer, Austin Craig, Rizal, “in order to
        obtain a better education, had had to leave his country stealthily like
        a fugitive from justice, and his family, to save themselves from
        persecution, were compelled to profess ignorance of his plans and
        movements. His name was entered in Santo Tomas at the opening of the new
        term, with the fees paid, and Paciano had gone to Manila pretending to
        be looking for this brother whom he had assisted out of the country.”
      </Text>

      <Text>
        Rizal earned a Licentiate in Medicine at the Universidad Central de
        Madrid, where he also took courses in philosophy and literature. It was
        in Madrid that he conceived of writing Noli Me Tangere. He also attended
        the University of Paris and, in 1887, completed his eye specialization
        course at the University of Heidelberg. It was also in that year that
        Rizal’s first novel was published (in Berlin).

        of the line. But at the end of the month, he became ‘emperor´ of his
        Empire. Hewas the brightest pupil in the whole class, and he was awarded

      <Text>
        {" "}

        dungeon of Chateau d’If, his finding a buried treasure in the rocky
        island of Monte Cristo, and his dramatic revenge on his enemies who had
        wronged him.

        of Cesar Cantu’s historical work entitled Universal History. He also
        read Travels in the Philippines by Dr. Feodor Jagor, a German
        scientist-traveler who visited Phil in 1859-60. He was impressed by:
      </Text>
      <Text>
        1. Jagor’s keen observations of the defects of Spanish colonization
      </Text>
      <Text>

      <Text>INTIMATE ALLIANCE BETWEEN RELIGION AND GOOD EDUCATION</Text>
      <Text>
        Rizal shared his thoughts about the importance of education to enlighten
        the nation which was useful to gain societal freedom for every nation.
        It may also provide us the necessary knowledge, skills and attitude to
        expand the horizon of our thoughts. However, this would not be enough to
        be properly educated. Rizal thought that there was really an intimate
        alliance between religion and good education.

        Dr Jose Rizal is arguably one of the most well known devotees of the
        Virgin of Antipolo and he frequently references her in many of his
        works. But how does it all begin?

        In his memoirs of his younger years, he narrates that his mother Doña
        Teodora Alonzo, a member of the Venerable Third Order of St. Francis of
        Assisi, had a difficult pregnancy that she almost died of childbirth
        because of his big head have she not made a vow to the Virgin of
        Antipolo to make a pilgrimage to her shrine if she will have a safe
        delivery of Jose.

        He was able to fulfill this promise on June 6, 1868, accompanied by his
        father, Don Francisco Mercado Rizal since Doña Teodora was advancing
        with age and just gave birth to his sister which limits her movements in
        the years to come. He also kept a souvenir print of the Virgin of
        Antipolo that he brings along to his travels.

        In his student life in Manila, the role of the Virgin of Antipolo is
        still prominent in his life where he notes that brings print of the
        image of the Virgin when he left home for school and later in his
        travels during his adulthood. In 1880, the Virgin of Antipolo would
        become Rizal’s muse when he wrote the zarzuela (one act play) entitled
        “Junto al Pasig” (Along the Pasig) while he was taking both his pre
        medicine and medicine proper courses at the University of Santo Tomas (a
        rare privilege for a student like him which dispels the long standing
        misinformation that he suffered mistreatment at the University).

        (Beside the Pasig), a one-act zarzuela in Spanish written by the
        Philippine national hero, Jose Rizal, was staged by the Academy of
        Spanish literature members on December 8, 1880. Rizal wrote it to honor

        Although he was a student of UST at that time, the Jesuits of Ateneo,
        whom he remained close with after completing his studies there, asked
        him to contribute to the festivities in honor of La Inmaculada
        Concepcion (the Patroness of Ateneo) as the president of the Academia de
        la Literatura Castellana in Ateneo Municipal de Manila and it is from
        this request that he wrote the said zarzuela. The one act play was
        performed by the members of the Academia on December 8, 1880 – Feast of
        the Immaculate Conception and the music for the choruses was written by
        a Spanish professor, Blas Echegoyen.

        The play basically poses 7 questions related with what christians
        believe through leonido, the main character,a teenager, Rizal portrayed
        another perspective of Satan and the virgin mary. He centers on thoughts
        such as who is the real redeemer of mankind? Who should really be
        adored? Who should one believe? Hence, the play starts when Candido
        Pascual and other children were waiting for the coming of the Virgin
        Mary(through the procession)& the children boasted on who had the best
        present for the Virgin. The first boy proudly states about his bird cage
        at home, the second boy boasts of flowers, the third one wants
        firecrackers, Meanwhile, Pascual says that he has a flute. Before they
        end up in a fight, Candido, barged in their conversation and suggested
        that they all help one another in setting up a banca (dugout canoe) with
        colorful pennants and banners and paddle slowly into the river. He then
        asked each to bring his own present for the lady (flute, bird cage,
        flowers, and firecrackers). The rest of the children agreed. However,
        sometime later, they realized that their leader Leonido was missing.
        Thus, they searched for him.
