        <Text>
          Rizal’s first essay, “The Love of Country,” was written when he was 21
          and newly arrived in Madrid. It was published under the name of “Laong
          Laan'' on 20 August 1882 in Diariong Tagalog.” A Philippine newspaper,
          then on 31 October 1890 in La Solidaridad, Madrid.

          This essay is a poignant dissertation of what Rizal calls a “beautiful
          but hackneyed subject,” love of country. In crystallizing his concept
          of love of country, Rizal reveals a foretaste of the style and
          substance of his novels. He could have had Maria Clara and Sisa when
          described the country as “enveloped in morning clouds and mist, always
          beautiful and poetic, and the more idolized by her sons when they are
          absent and far away from her. "Love of a country is the purest, most
          heroic and most sublime human sentiment. It is gratitude, it is
          affection for everything that reminds us of something of the first
          days of our life; it is the land where our ancestors are sleeping.
          Love of country is never effaced once it has penetrated the heart,
          because it carries with it a divine stamp which renders it eternal and
          imperishable. Of all loves, that of country is the greatest, the most
          heroic and the most disinterested. Some have sacrificed for her their
          youth, their pleasures. Others have dedicated to her the splendors of
          their genius others shed their blood all have died, bequeathing to
          their Motherland an immense future: liberty and glory.

          This idea of dying for the country reverberated in Rizal’s writings.
          In a letter to Mariano Ponce, he declared: If one has to die, at least
          one must die in his own country, by his country and for his country. A
          year later, Rizal decided to return to the Philippines, the first step
          that would ultimately lead to his death for the country: I believe
          that it is now the opportune time for me to return to the Philippines
          and share with them all the dangers. For I have always been of the
          opinion that I can do more in my country than abroad. What good have I
          done in these three years, and what evil had occurred because I was in
          my country. "Rizal's Love for the Motherland our national hero, Jose
          Rizal, loved his country deeply. He had been to free, lovely,
          prosperous, and developed nations, yet he always preferred to return
          to his own. Love of country, the native land, the motherland, and the
          land of birth – this was the very character that defined his
          personality. He was about 21 years old when he went to Spain for the
          first time in May 1882. While traveling, he recorded in his diary that
          his motherland was the seat of all his affection and that he loved it
          that no matter how beautiful Europe would be, he would still like to
          go back to her (Reminiscences and Travels of Jose Rizal, Centennial
          Edition, Manila: Jose Rizal National Centennial Commission, 1961).

          Here is a beautiful subject, and because it is beautiful, it is very
          back eyed. Learned man, poet, artist, laborer, merchant, or soldier,
          old or young, king or slave- all have pondered it and devoted to it
          the most valued fruits of their intelligence, or of their hearts. From
          the cultured European, free, and proud of his glorious history, to the
          African Negro dragged out of his forests and sold for a paltry sum;
          from ancient peoples whose shadows still hover over their somber
          ruins-the tombs of their glories and sufferings-to the modern nations,
          full of activity and life, all, all have had and have an idol whom
          they call Motherland-beautiful, brilliant, sublime but implacable,
          haughty, and exacting. A thousand tongues have sung to her, a thousand
          lyres have offered her their most sonorous music; the most favored
          intellect have displayed before her memory, their most resplendent
          fineries. She has been the universal cry of peace, of love, and of
          glory because she is in the hearts and minds of all men, and like the
          light enclosed in limpid crystal, she goes forth in the form of the
          most intense splendors.

          And will this be an obstacle to us who wish to treat of her? And can
          we not dedicate to her something, we whose only sin is to have been
          born later? Would the XIXth century serve as an excuse for us to be
          ungrateful? No. The rich mine of the heart has not yet been exhausted.
          Her remembrance is always prolific, and no matter how little
          inspiration we have, positively we will find in the bottom of our
          soul, if not a rich treasure, a mite, poor but an enthusiastic
          manifestation of our sentiments. In the manner then of the ancient
          Hebrews who offered in the temple the first fruits of their love, we
          in foreign land will dedicate our first utterances to our country,
          enveloped in morning clouds and mist, always beautiful and poetic, and
          the more idolized by her sons when they are absent and far away from
          her.

          And this is not surprising, because it is a very natural feeling;
          because there in our country are first memories of childhood, a merry
          ode, known only in childhood, from whose races spring forth the flower
          of innocence and happiness; because there slumbers a whole past and a
          future can be hoped, because in her forests and in her meadows, on
          every tree, on every blade, on every flower you see engraved the
          memory of a being you love, as her breath in the perfumed breeze, her
          song in the murmur of the fountain, her smile in the rainbow of the
          sky, or her sighs in the confused moans of the night wind.

          It is because you see there with the eyes of your imagination, under
          the tranquil roof of your old home, a family who remembers you and
          awaits you, thinking of you and worrying about you; in short because
          in her sky, in her sun, in her seas, and in her forests, you find
          poetry, tenderness, and love and even in the cemetery there is a
          humble tomb awaiting you to return you to the soil. Will there be a
          genie who will bind your heart to the soil of our native country, who
          beautifies and adorns everything, showing us all objects in a poetic
          and sentimental aspect and captivating our hearts. Because under
          whatever aspect she may appear, whether she is dressed in purple,
          crowned with flowers and laurels, powerful and rich; whether she is
          sorrowful and solitary, clad in rags and a slave, entreating her slave
          sons; whether she is a nymph in a pleasant garden beside the blue
          waves of the sea, gracious and beautiful as the dream of deluded
          youth; whether she is enveloped in a shroud of snow, sitting, fatidic
          ally on the ends of the earth under a sunless and starless sky;
          whatever her name, her age, or her fortune might be, we love her
          always, as the child loves his mother even in the midst of hunger and
          misery,
        </Text>
        <Text>
          And how strange: The poorer and more wretched she is, the more one is
          willing to suffer for her, the more she is adored, the more one finds
          pleasure in bearing up with her. It has been observed that the people
          of the mountains and wild valleys and those born on barren and dismal
          land are the very ones who can remember more vividly their country,
          finding in the cities a terrible boredom which compels them to return
          to their native land. Is it because love of country is the purest,
          most heroic, and most sublime human sentiment? It is gratitude; it is
          affection for everything that reminds us of something of the first
          days of our life; it is the land where our ancestors are sleeping; it
          is the temple where we have worshipped God with the candor of babbling
          childhood; it is the sound of the church bell which has delighted us
          since a child; they are the vast fields, the blue lake, the
          picturesque banks of the river which we pass by in a nimble boat; the
          limpid brook which laves the cheerful little house nestling among
          flowers like a love-nest; or the tall mountain which inspire us this
          pleasant sentiment? Will it be the raging storm that lashes, and
          knocks down everything it finds on its way; the lightning which,
          escaping from the hands of the Almighty annihilates everything; will
          it be the avalanche or cascade, matters of perpetual motion and
          endless menace? Is it all this that attracts, captivates, and entices
          us?.{" "}

        <Text>
          Probably these beauties or tender remembrances fortify the tie that
          unites us to our native land, engendering a pleasant feeling of
          wellbeing when we are in our country, or deep melancholy when we are
          far away from her, the origin of a cruel disease called nostalgia.

          Oh! Never sadden the stranger who arrives at your shores; do not
          awaken in him that vivid memory of his country, the comforts of his
          home, because then you will evoke this sickness, tenacious phantom
          that will not abandon him until he sees again his native land or he

          But, on the other hand, love of country is never effaced once it has

          It has been said that love has always been the most powerful force

          country is the greatest, the most heroic and the most disinterested.
          Read history, if not, the annals, the traditions. Go to the homes,
          what sacrifices, self-denial and tears are held on the sacred altar of
          the nation. From Brutus, who condemned his sons charged with treason,
          to Guzman the Good who allowed his son to die in order not to fail in
          his duty, what dramas, what tragedies what martyrdom have not been
          enacted for the welfare of that inexorable divinity who has nothing to
          give you in return for your children but gratitude and blessings! And
          notwithstanding, with the pieces of their hearts they raise glorious
          monuments to their motherland; with the work of their hands, with the
          sweat of their brow, they have sprinkled and made fruitful her sacred
          tree, and neither have they expected nor received any reward.

          truth; he solves a problem; hunger and thirst, cold and heat; sickness
          and misfortune have successively confronted him. He is going down his
          grave and avails of his agony to offer to his motherland a rosette for
          her crown, a truth- fountain and origin of a thousand benefits.

          The motherland is in danger! Soldiers and leaders as if by charm

          farewell to the quiet pleasures of the home and hide under their
          helmets the tears that tenderness draws. They all leave and die.
          Perhaps he is the father of many children, fair and pinkish like
          cherubs; perhaps he is a young man of smiling hopes- a son or a
          lover-it does not matter. He has defended the one who gave him life he
          has fulfilled his duty. Peter or Leonides, whoever he might be, the

            - Noli Me Tángere (Latin for "Touch Me Not") is a novel by Filipino
            writer and activist José Rizal and was published during the Spanish
            colonial period of the Philippines. It explores inequities in law
            and practice in terms of the treatment by the ruling government and
            the Spanish Catholic friars of the resident peoples in the late-19th
            century.

            - Originally written by Rizal in Spanish, the book has since been
            more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either
            Tagalog (the major indigenous language), or English. The Rizal Law
            requires Noli and its sequel, El filibusterismo, to be read by all
            high school students throughout the country. Noli is studied in
            Grade 9 and El filibusterismo in Grade 10. The two novels are widely
            considered to be the national epic of the Philippines. They have
            been adapted in many forms, such as operas, musicals, plays, and
            other forms of art.

            - The title originates from the Biblical passage John 20:13-17. In
            Rizal's time, it also referred to cancers that occurred on the face,
            particularly cancers of the eyelid; touching such lesions irritated
            them, causing pain. As an ophthalmologist, Rizal was familiar with
            the cancer and the name. He is explicit about the connection in the
            novel's dedication, which begins: A mi patria ('To my country') and
            continues with a cancer of such malignant a character that the least
            touch irritates it and awakens in it the sharpest pains. Rizal
            probes the cancers of Filipino society. Early English translations
            of the novel used different titles, such as An Eagle Flight (1900)
            and The Social Cancer (1912), but more recent English translations
            use the original title.

          <Text>
            - Rizal intended to express the way Filipino culture was perceived
            to be backward, anti-progress, anti-intellectual, and not conducive
            to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. At the time, he was a
            student of medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid.

            - Other Filipinos were also working or studying in Madrid which, as
            the capital of Spain, was the center of culture and universities. At
            a gathering on January 2, 1884, of friends at the house of Pedro A.
            Paterno, Rizal proposed that a group of Filipinos should collaborate
            on a novel about the Philippines. His proposal was unanimously
            approved by those present, among whom were Pedro, Máximo Viola and

            Lete, Julio Llorente, and Valentin Ventura. However, they never got
            into the project. Although agreeing to help, none of the others
            wrote anything. Initially, Rizal planned for the novel to encompass
            all phases of Filipino life, but most of his friends, all young
            males, wanted to write about women. Rizal saw that his companions
            spent more time gambling and flirting with Spanish women than
            writing. Because of this, he decided to draft the novel alone.

            - Crisóstomo Ibarra, the mestizo son of the recently deceased Don
            Rafael Ibarra, is returning to San Diego town in Laguna after seven
            years of study in Europe. Kapitán Tiago, a family friend, invites
            him to a reunion party in Manila. At the party, Crisóstomo meets
            Padre Dámaso who was San Diego's parish priest when Crisóstomo left
            for Europe. Dámaso treats Crisóstomo with hostility, to the surprise
            of the young man who regarded the priest as his father's friend.
            Later, as Crisóstomo was walking back to his hotel, Lieutenant
            Guevara, another friend of his father, informs him that Don Rafael
            may have been killed for political reasons and Dámaso may have been
            involved. Guevara warns him to be careful.

            - The following day, Crisóstomo returns to Tiago's home to meet with
            his childhood sweetheart, Tiago's daughter María Clara. As the two
            flirt and reminisce, María reads back to him a part of his farewell
            letter on his discussion with his father about the state of the
            country. Ibarra excuses himself eventually as it was time to go to
            San Diego.

            - Arriving in San Diego, Crisóstomo goes to the cemetery and finds
            his father's grave desecrated. He seeks out the gravedigger who then
            tells him that the parish priest had ordered Don Rafael's remains
            transferred to the Chinese cemetery, but that he threw the corpse
            into the lake instead out of fear and pity. At that moment, the
            town's new parish priest, Padre Bernardo Salví, passes by wherein an
            enraged Crisóstomo pushes him to the ground, demanding an
            explanation; a fearful Salví states that he was only newly assigned
            to the town but reveals that Padre Dámaso ordered the transfer.

            - Crisóstomo decides to forgive and commits to improvements in his
            town. He plans to build a private school, believing that his
            paisanos would benefit from a more modern education than what is
            offered in the government schools, which were under the influence of
            the friars. Enjoying widespread support from the locals and Spanish
            authorities, Crisóstomo's project advances quickly. He receives
            counsel from Don Anastacio, a local philosopher, and recruits a
            progressive schoolmaster. Construction was set to begin shortly with
            the cornerstone to be laid in a few weeks during San Diego's town
            fiesta.

            - One day, Crisóstomo, María and their friends go on a picnic along
            the shores of the Laguna de Baý. They discover that a crocodile had
            been lurking in the Ibarras' fish pens. The boatman jumps into the
            water with a knife drawn. Crisóstomo follows him and the two subdue
            the animal together. Elías, the boatman, proclaims himself indebted
            to Crisóstomo.

            - On the day of the fiesta, Elías warns Crisóstomo of a plot to kill
            him at the cornerstone ceremony. Sure enough, Crisóstomo evades
            injury and the would-be assassin is killed. During the luncheon, an
            uninvited Padre Dámaso further berates Crisóstomo. The other guests
            hiss for discretion, but Dámaso carries on and insults the memory of
            Don Rafael. Crisóstomo then loses control, strikes the friar
            unconscious and holds a knife to his neck. Crisóstomo tells the
            guests about Dámaso's schemes that resulted in his father's death,
            but releases Dámaso when María Clara pleads for mercy. Crisóstomo is
            excommunicated from the Church, but has it lifted in Manila through
            the intercession of the sympathetic captain-general. Returning to
            San Diego, he finds María ill and refuses to see him.

            - Meanwhile, Elías senses Crisóstomo's influence with the government
            and takes him for a sail so they can talk in private. Elías reveals
            that a revolutionary group had been trying to recruit him but he
            stalled in order to get Crisóstomo's views first. The conversation
            shifts to Elías' family history. It turns out that Elías'
            grandfather, in his youth, worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila
            office, but one night a fire consumes the office and the Spanish
            proprietor accuses him of arson. He was prosecuted and jailed; upon
            release, he was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker.
            His wife turned to prostitution to support the family. Their lives
            were ruined.

            - Crisóstomo says that he cannot help and his school project is his
            focus. Rebuffed, Elías advices Crisóstomo to avoid him in the
            future, for his own safety. However, Elías returns a few days later
            to tell him of a rogue uprising planned for that same night. The
            instigators had used Crisóstomo's name in vain to recruit
            malcontents. The authorities know of the uprising and are prepared
            to spring a trap on the rebels. Realizing the scheme's
            repercussions, Crisóstomo abandons his school project and enlists
            Elías in sorting out and destroying documents that may implicate
            him. Elías obliges, but comes across a name familiar to him: Don
            Pedro Eibarramendia. Crisóstomo says Pedro was his great-grandfather
            and that they had to shorten his long family name. Elías responds
            that Eibarramendia was the same Spaniard who accused his grandfather
            of arson, and thus condemned Elías and his family to misfortune.
            Elias leaves the house in consternation.

            The following morning, the instigators are found dead—Padre Salví,
            the mastermind of the uprising, ordered his senior sexton to kill
            them in order to silence them. Meanwhile, Elias sneaks back into the
            Ibarra mansion and sorts through documents and valuables, then burns
            down the house. Crisóstomo and his co-accused are loaded into horse
            carts and taken to prison with their townmates shouting in anger and
            casting stones as they pass.

            - Kapitán Tiago later on hosts a dinner at his riverside house in
            Manila to celebrate María Clara's engagement with Alfonso Linares, a
            Peninsular who was presented as her new suitor following
            Crisóstomo's excommunication. Present at the party were Padre Salví,
            Padre Sibyla, Lieutenant Guevarra, and other acquaintances. They
            spoke of the events in San Diego and Crisóstomo's fate. Salví, who
            lusted after María Clara all along and staged the uprising in order
            to frame Crisóstomo, says he requested to be moved to the Convent of
            the Poor Clares in Manila under the pretense of the San Diego
            uprising being too much for him.

            - Guevara outlines how the court came to condemn Crisóstomo. In a
            signed letter he wrote before leaving for Europe, Crisóstomo spoke
            of his father, an alleged rebel who died in prison. Somehow this
            letter fell into the hands of an enemy, and Crisóstomo's handwriting
            was copied to create recruitment letters for the uprising. The
            signature on the letters was similar to Crisóstomo's seven years
            before, but not to the present day. Crisóstomo only had to deny
            ownership of the signature on the original letter and the case built
            on the bogus letters would be dismissed. But upon seeing the letter,
            which was of course his farewell letter to María Clara, Crisóstomo
            lost the will to fight the charges, and he was sentenced to be
            deported. Guevara then approaches María who had been listening.
            Privately but sorrowfully, he congratulates her for her common sense
            in yielding the letter. Now, she can live a life of peace. María is
            devastated.

            - Later that evening Crisóstomo, having escaped prison with the help
            of Elías, confronts María in secret. María admits giving up his
            letter because Salví found Dámaso's old letters in the San Diego
            parsonage, letters from María's mother who was then pregnant with
            her and begging Dámaso for an abortion. It turns out that Dámaso was
            María's biological father. Salví promised not to divulge Dámaso's
            letters in exchange for Crisóstomo's farewell letter. Crisóstomo
            forgives her, María swears her undying love, and they part with a
            kiss.

            - Crisóstomo and Elías slip unnoticed through the Estero de Binondo
            and into the Pasig River. Elías tells Crisóstomo that his family
            treasure is buried at the Ibarra forest in San Diego. Wishing to
            make restitution, Crisóstomo tells Elías to flee with him to a
            foreign country where they will live as brothers. Elías declines,
            stating that his fate lies with the country he wishes to reform.
            Crisóstomo then tells him of his own desire for revolution to
            lengths that even Elías was unwilling to go. Just then, sentries
            catch up with their boat at the mouth of the Pasig River and pursue
            them across Laguna de Bay. Elías orders Crisóstomo to lie down and
            to meet him at his family's mausoleum in the forest. Elías then
            jumps into the water to distract the pursuers and is shot several
            times.

            had been killed by sentries in pursuit. She remorsefully demands of
            Dámaso that her wedding with Linares be canceled and that she be
            entered into the cloister, or the grave. Seeing her resolution,
            Dámaso admits he ruined Crisóstomo because he was a mere mestizo and
            Dámaso wanted María to be happy and secure, and that was possible
            only if she married a peninsular Spaniard. Knowing why Salví had
            earlier requested to be assigned to the Convent of the Poor Clares,
            Dámaso pleads with María to reconsider, but to no avail. Weeping,
            Dámaso consents, knowing the horrible fate that awaits his daughter
            within the convent but finding it more tolerable than her suicide.

            - A few nights later in the Ibarra forest, a boy pursues his mother
            through the darkness. The woman went insane with the constant
            beating of her husband, the death of her younger son in the hands of
            Padre Salví, and the loss of her elder son to the Guardia Civil.
            Basilio, the boy, catches up with Sisa, his mother, inside the
            Ibarra mausoleum, but the strain had already been too great for
            Sisa. She dies in Basilio's embrace. As Basilio grieves for his
            mother, Elías stumbles into the mausoleum, himself dying from his
            wounds. He instructs Basilio to cremate their bodies and if no one
            comes, to dig inside the mausoleum, where he will find treasures,
            which he is to use for his own education.

            whispers that he will die without seeing the dawn of freedom for his
            people, and that those who see it must welcome it and not forget
            those who died in the darkness. Upon returning, Basilio encounters
            Ibarra also mourning for Elias. The two build a pyre for them before
            burying their remains. Following the funeral, Ibarra and Basilio dig
            the mausoleum for the treasures, which the latter receives a share
            of. Before letting Basilio leave, Ibarra re-echoes Elias' dying
            advice on the use of the treasures to the boy.

            depression, became addicted to opium and faded to obscurity. Salví,
            while waiting for his consecration as a bishop, serves as chaplain
            of the Convent of the Poor Clares. Meanwhile, during a stormy
            evening in September, two patrolmen reported seeing a specter on the
            roof of the convent weeping in despair. The next day, a government
            representative visited the convent to try to investigate the
            previous night's events. One of the nuns had a wet and torn gown and
            with tears told the representative of "tales of horror" and begged
            for "protection against the outrages of hypocrisy" (strongly
            suggesting that Padre Salví regularly rapes her when he is in the
            convent). The abbess, however, said that she was mad. A general also
            attempted to investigate the nun's case but by then, the abbess
            prohibited visits to the convent. Nothing more was said about this
            nun, or for that matter, María Clara.

          <Text>
            - Rizal depicted nationality by emphasizing the positive qualities
            of Filipinos: the devotion of a Filipina and her influence on a
            man's life, the deep sense of gratitude, and the solid common sense
            of the Filipinos under the Spanish regime.

            - The work was instrumental in creating a unified Filipino national
            identity and consciousness, as many natives previously identified
            with their respective regions. It lampooned, caricatured and exposed
            various elements in colonial society. Two characters in particular
            have become classics in Filipino culture: María Clara, who has
            become a personification of the ideal Filipino woman, loving and
            unwavering in her loyalty to her spouse; and the priest Father
            Dámaso, who reflects the covert fathering of illegitimate children
            by members of the Spanish clergy.

        <View className="flex-row space-x-2 ml-4">

            - The book indirectly influenced the Philippine Revolution of
            independence from the Spanish Empire, even though Rizal actually
            advocated direct representation to the Spanish government and an
            overall larger role for the Philippines within Spain's political
            affairs. In 1956, Congress passed Republic Act 1425, more popularly
            known as the Rizal Law, which requires all levels in Philippine
            schools to teach the novel as part of their curriculum. Noli Me
            Tángere is being taught to third-year secondary school (now Grade 9,
            due to the new K-12 curriculum) students, while its sequel El
            Filibusterismo is being taught for fourth-year secondary school (now
            Grade 10) students. The novels are incorporated into their study and
            survey of Philippine literature. Both of Rizal's novels were
            initially banned from Catholic educational institutions given its
            negative portrayal of the Church, but this taboo has been largely
            superseded as religious schools conformed to the Rizal Law.
