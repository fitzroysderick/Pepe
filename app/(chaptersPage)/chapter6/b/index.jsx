            - "Hymn To Labor" is a patriotic and didactic poem that emphasizes
            the importance of labor in society. Unlike Rizal's earlier works
            that focused on romanticism and individualism, this poem celebrates
            the collective efforts of the Filipino people.

            - Its structure consists of a chorus and verses sung by men, wives,
            maidens, and children. Each group extols the virtues of labor and
            its role in supporting the motherland, family, and individual
            fulfillment. The language is simple and direct, conveying a clear
            message of national unity and the dignity of work.

          <Text>
            - Indolence is the inclination to laziness or sloth. It is a
            socio-political essay published in La solidaridad in Madrid in 1890.
            It was written by José Rizal as a response to the accusation of
            Indio or Malay indolence, it's an exploratory essay that explains
            the alleged idleness of his people during the Spanish colonization.
            It is a study of the causes why the people did not, as was said,
            work hard during the Spanish regime.

            - Rizal says that an illness will worsen if the wrong treatment is
            given. The past writings on indolence revolve only on either denying
            or affirming, and never studying its causes in depth. Some writings
            even implies a notion that Filipinos are by nature indolent. He
            argued through his essay that even before the Spaniards arrived the
            early Filipinos were already carrying out trade within provinces and
            with other neighboring countries; they were also engaged in
            agriculture and mining; some natives even spoke Spanish. All this
            disproves the notion that Filipinos are by nature indolent. Rizal
            ends by asking what then would have caused Filipinos to forget their
            past.

            • The hot climate: Filipinos cannot be compared to Europeans who
            live in cold countries. Filipinos must exert much more effort at
            work because of this climate. An hour's work under the Philippine
            sun, he says, is equivalent to a day's work in temperate regions.

            • The establishment of the Galleon Trade cut off all previous
            associations of the Philippines with other countries in Asia and the
            Middle East. As a result, business was only conducted with Spain
            through Mexico. Because of this, the small businesses and handicraft
            industries that flourished during the pre-Spanish period gradually
            disappeared.

            • Spain extinguished the natives' love of work because of the
            implementation of forced labor. Because of the wars between Spain
            and other countries in Europe as well as the Muslims in Mindanao,
            the Filipinos were compelled to work in shipyards, roads, and other
            public works, abandoning agriculture, industry, and commerce.

            • Spain did not protect the people against foreign invaders and
            pirates. With no arms to defend themselves, the natives were killed,
            their houses burned, and their lands destroyed. As a result of this,
            the Filipinos were forced to become nomads, lost interest in
            cultivating their lands or in rebuilding the industries that were
            shut down, and simply became submissive to the mercy of God.

            the schools were repetitive prayers and other things that could not
            be used by the students to lead the country to progress. There were
            no courses in Agriculture, Industry, etc., which were badly needed
            by the Philippines during those times.

            doing nothing in line with their duties. The women were seen
            constantly followed by servants who dressed them and fanned them -

            easily enter heaven after they died.

            reduced to inaction.

            request of Marcelo H. del Pilar. The salient points contained in

            Christ and His Church. Most of them were corrupted by worldly
            desires and used worldly methods to effect change and force

        <View className="flex-row space-x-2 ml-4">
          <Text>
            - Jose Rizal was greatly impressed by the fighting spirit that the
            young women of Malolos had shown. In his letter, he expresses great
            joy and satisfaction over the battle they had fought. In this
            portion of Rizal's letter, it is obvious that his ultimate desire
            was for women to be offered the same opportunities as those received
            by men in terms of education. During those days young girls were not
            sent to school because of the universal notion that they would soon
            only be taken as wives and stay at home with the children. Rizal,
            however, emphasizes on freedom of thought and the right to
            education, which must be granted to both boys and girls alike.

            - Rizal stipulates a number of important points in this portion of

            however, is that whatever a mother shows to her children is what the
            children will become also. If the mother is always kissing the hand
            of the friars in submission, then her children will grow up to be
            sycophants and mindless fools who do nothing but do as they are
            told, even if the very nature of the task would violate their rights
            as individuals.
