            - El Filibusterismo (translate. The filibusterism; The Subversive or
            The Subversion, as in the Locsín English translation, are also
            possible translations), also known by its alternative English title
            The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine
            national hero José Rizal. It is the sequel to Noli Me Tángere and,
            like the first book, was written in Spanish. It was first published
            in 1891 in Ghent.

            - The novel centers on the Noli-El Fili duology's main character
            Crisóstomo Ibarra, now returning for vengeance as "Simoun". The
            novel's dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel's
            hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying Ibarra's resort to
            solving his country's issues through violent means, after his
            previous attempt in reforming the country's system made no effect
            and seemed impossible with the corrupt attitude of the Spaniards
            toward the Filipinos.

            - The novel, along with its predecessor, was banned in some parts of
            the Philippines as a result of their portrayals of the Spanish
            government's abuses and corruption. These novels, along with Rizal's
            involvement in organizations that aimed to address and reform the
            Spanish system and its issues, led to Rizal's exile to Dapitan and
            eventual execution. Both the novel and its predecessor, along with
            Rizal's last poem, are now considered Rizal's literary masterpieces.

            - Both of Rizal's novels had a profound effect on Philippine society
            in terms of views about national identity, the Catholic faith and
            its influence on the Filipino's choice, and the government's issues
            in corruption, abuse of power, and discrimination, and on a larger
            scale, the issues related to the effect of colonization on people's
            lives and the cause for independence. These novels later on
            indirectly became the inspiration to start the Philippine
            Revolution.

            - Throughout the Philippines, the reading of both the novel and its
            predecessor is now mandatory for high school students throughout the
            archipelago, although it is now read using English, Filipino, and
            the Philippines' regional languages.

          <Text>
            - In the events of the previous novel, Crisóstomo Ibarra, a
            reform-minded mestizo who tried to establish a modern school in his
            hometown of San Diego and marry his childhood sweetheart, was
            falsely accused of rebellion and presumed dead after a shootout
            following his escape from prison. Elías, his friend who was also a
            reformer, sacrificed his life to give Crisóstomo a chance to regain
            his treasure and flee the country, and hopefully continue their
            crusade for reforms from abroad. After a thirteen-year absence from
            the country, a more revolutionary Crisóstomo has returned, having
            taken the identity of Simoun, a mysterious wealthy jeweler whose
            objective is to drive the government to commit as much abuse as
            possible in order to drive people into revolution.

            - Simoun goes from town to town presumably to sell his jewels.
            Reaching San Diego, he detours to the Ibarras' forested land to
            retrieve more of his treasures buried in the mausoleum. There, his
            true identity as Crisóstomo Ibarra is discovered by a now-grown
            Basilio, who was also in the mausoleum visiting his mother's grave.
            In the years since the death of his mother, Basilio had been serving
            as Capitán Tiago's servant in exchange for being allowed to study,
            and is now an aspiring doctor in his last year at university as well
            as administrator and heir apparent to Capitán Tiago's wealth. Simoun
            reveals his motives to Basilio and offers him a place in his plans.
            Too secure of his place in the world, Basilio declines.

            - At Barrio Sagpang in the town of Tiani, Simoun stays at the house
            of the village's cabeza de barangay, Tales. Having suffered
            misfortune after misfortune in recent years, Kabesang Tales is
            unable to resist the temptation to steal Simoun's revolver and join
            the bandits. In Los Baños, Simoun joins his friend, the
            Captain-General, who is then taking a break from a hunting
            excursion. In a friendly game of cards with him and his cronies,
            Simoun raises the stakes higher and higher and half-jokingly secures
            blank orders for deportation, imprisonment, and summary execution
            from the Captain-General.

            - Later on, Simoun goes to Manila and meets Quiroga, a wealthy
            Chinese businessman and aspiring consul-general for the Chinese
            empire. Knowing Quiroga is heavily in his debt, Simoun offers him a
            steep discount if the former stores his massive arsenal of rifles in
            Quiroga's warehouses, to be used presumably for extortion activities
            with Manila's elite. Despite his hatred of guns and weaponry,
            Quiroga reluctantly agrees to do the job and uses his bazaar as a
            front.

            - During the Quiapo Fair, a talking heads exhibit ostensibly
            organized by an American named Mr. Leeds but secretly commissioned
            by Simoun is drawing popular acclaim. Padre Bernardo Salví, now
            chaplain of the Convent of the Poor Clares,attends one of the
            performances. The exhibit is set in Ptolemaic Egypt but features a
            tale that closely resembles that of Crisóstomo Ibarra and María
            Clara, and their fate under Salví. The show ends with an ominous vow
            of revenge. Deeply overcome with guilt and fear, Salví recommends
            the show be banned, but not before Mr. Leeds sailed for Hong Kong.

            - Months pass and the night of Simoun's revolution comes. Simoun
            visits Basilio in Tiago's house and tries to convince him again to
            join his revolution. He reveals his plan for the attack: a cannon
            volley shall be fired, at which point Kabesang Tales, now a bandit
            identifying himself as Matanglawin, and Simoun, who managed to
            deceive and recruit a sizable rogue force among the government
            troops, will lead their forces into the city. The leaders of the
            Church, the University, scores of bureaucrats, the Captain-General
            himself, as well as the bulk of officers guarding them are all
            conveniently located in one place, the theater where a controversial
            and much-hyped performance of Les cloches de Corneville is taking
            place. While Simoun and Matanglawin direct their forces, Basilio and
            several others are to raid the Convent of the Poor Clares and rescue
            María Clara.

            - However, Basilio reports to Simoun that María Clara died just that
            afternoon, after suffering the travails of monastic life under
            Salví, who always lusted after her. Simoun, driven by grief, aborts
            the attack and becomes crestfallen throughout the night. It will be
            reported later on that he suffered an "accident" that night, leaving
            him confined to his bed.

            - The following day, posters threatening violence to the leaders of
            the university and the government are found at the university doors.
            A reform-oriented student group to which Basilio belonged is named
            the primary suspects; the members are arrested, including Basilio,
            despite his absence from the group's mock dinner the night before.
            They are eventually freed through the intercession of relatives,
            except for Basilio who is an orphan and has no means to pay for his
            freedom. During his imprisonment, he learns that Capitán Tiago has
            died, leaving him with nothing; it is revealed that Tiago's will was
            actually forged by his spiritual advisor Padre Írene, who also
            supplied him with opium; his childhood sweetheart Juli has committed
            suicide to avoid getting raped by parish priest Camorra when she
            tried asking for help on Basilio's behalf; and that he has missed
            his graduation and will be required to study for another year, but
            now with no funds to go by. Released through the intercession of
            Simoun, a darkened, disillusioned Basilio joins Simoun's cause
            wholeheartedly.

            - Simoun, meanwhile, has been organizing a new revolution, and he
            reveals his plans to a now committed Basilio. The wedding of Juanito
            Peláez and Paulita Gómez will be used to coordinate the attack upon
            the city. As the Peláez and Gómez families are prominent members of
            the Manila elite, leaders of the church and civil government are
            invited to the reception. The Captain-General, who declined to
            extend his tenure despite Simoun's urging, is leaving in two days
            and is the guest of honor.

            - Simoun will personally deliver a pomegranate-shaped crystal lamp
            as a wedding gift. The lamp is to be placed on a plinth at the
            reception venue and will be bright enough to illuminate the entire
            hall, which was also walled with mirrors. After some time the light
            will flicker as if to go out. When someone attempts to raise the
            wick, a mechanism hidden within the lamp containing fulminated
            mercury will detonate, igniting the lamp which is actually filled
            with nitroglycerin, killing everyone in an enormous blast.

            - At the sound of the explosion, Simoun's mercenaries will attack,
            reinforced by Matanglawin and his bandits who will descend upon the
            city from the surrounding hills. Simoun postulates that in the
            chaos, the masses, already worked to a panic by the government's
            heavy-handed response to the poster incident, as well as rumors of
            German ships in the bay to lend their firepower to any uprising
            against the Spanish government, will step out in desperation to kill
            or be killed. Basilio and a few others are to put themselves at
            their head and lead them to Quiroga's warehouses, where Simoun's
            guns are still being kept. The plan thus finalized, Simoun gives
            Basilio a loaded revolver and sends him away to await further
            instructions.

            - Basilio walks the streets for hours and passes by his old home,
            Capitán Tiago's riverside house on Anloague Street. He discovers
            that this was to be the reception venue – Juanito Peláez's father
            bought Tiago's house as a gift for the newlywed couple. Sometime
            later, he sees Simoun enter the house with the lamp, then hastily
            exit the house and board his carriage. Basilio begins to move away
            but sees Isagani, his friend and Paulita Gómez's former lover, sadly
            looking at Paulita through the window. Noting how close they were to
            the condemned house, Basilio tries to head Isagani off, but Isagani
            was too dazed with grief to listen to him. In desperation, Basilio
            reveals to Isagani how the house is set to explode at any time then.
            But when Isagani still refuses to heed him, Basilio flees, leaving
            Isagani to his fate.

            - Seeing Basilio's demeanor, Isagani is belatedly unnerved by the
            revelation. Isagani rushes into the house, seizes the lamp, and
            throws it into the river. With this, Simoun's second revolution
            fails as well.

            - In the following days, as the trappings at the reception venue are
            torn down, sacks containing gunpowder are discovered hidden under
            the boards all over the house. Simoun, who had directed the
            renovations, is exposed. With the Captain-General having left for
            Spain, Simoun is left without his protector and is forced to flee. A
            manhunt ensues and Simoun is chased as far away as the shores of the
            Pacific. He then spends the rest of his days hiding in the ancestral
            mansion of Padre Florentino, Isagani's uncle.

            - One day, the lieutenant of the local Guardia Civil informs
            Florentino that he received an order to arrest Simoun that night. In
            response, Simoun drinks the slow-acting poison which he always kept
            in a compartment in his treasure chest. Simoun then makes his final
            confession to Florentino, first revealing his true name, to
            Florentino's shock. He goes on to narrate how thirteen years before,
            as Crisóstomo Ibarra, he lost everything in the Philippines despite
            his good intentions. Crisóstomo swore vengeance. Retrieving some of
            his family's treasure that Elias had buried in the Ibarra mausoleum
            in the forest, Crisóstomo fled to foreign lands and engaged in
            trade. He took part in the war in Cuba, aiding first one side and
            then another, but always profiting. There Crisóstomo met the
            Captain-General who was then a major, whose goodwill he won first by
            loans of money, and afterwards by covering his criminal activity.
            Crisóstomo bribed his way to secure the major's promotion to
            Captain-General and his assignment to the Philippines. Once in the
            country, Crisóstomo then used him as a blind tool and invited him to
            all kinds of injustice, taking advantage of the Captain-General's
            insatiable lust for gold.

            - The confession is long and arduous, and night has fallen when
            Crisóstomo finishes. In the end, Florentino assures the dying man of
            God's mercy, but explains that his revolution failed because he has
            chosen means that God cannot sanction. Crisóstomo bitterly accepts
            the explanation and dies.

            - Realizing that the arresting officers will confiscate Crisóstomo's
            possessions, Florentino divests him of his jewels and casts them
            into the sea, proclaiming that they are best hidden under the waters
            for the time being to ensure that they cannot be used to distort
            justice or incite greed, and that God shall provide the means to
            draw them out should people need wealth for a righteous cause.

            Florentino, but is also rumored to be his son with his old
            sweetheart before priesthood. Isagani was finishing his studies at
            the Ateneo Municipal and is planning to take medicine. A member of
            the student association, Isagani is proud and naive, and tends to
            put himself on the spot when his ideals are affronted. His
            unrestrained idealism and poeticism clash with the more practical
            and mundane concerns of his girlfriend, Paulita Gómez. When Isagani
            allows himself to be arrested after their association is outlawed,
            Paulita leaves him for Juanito Peláez. In his final mention in the
            novel, he was bidding goodbye to his landlords, the Orenda family,
            to stay with Florentino permanently.

            Father Florentino – Isagani's uncle and a retired priest. Florentino
            was the son of a wealthy and influential Manila family. At his
            influential mother's insistence, he broke off an affair with his
            sweetheart and entered the priesthood, devoting himself to his
            parish. An indio (native), Florentino was a secular priest, one
            unaffiliated with the Catholic religious orders, yet his parish drew
            in huge income. When the 1872 Cavite mutiny broke out, he promptly
            resigned from priesthood, fearing unwanted attention. He retired to
            his family's large estate along the shores of the Pacific. He is
            described as white-haired, with a quiet, serene personality and a
            strong build. He did not smoke or drink. He was well respected by
            his peers, even by Spanish friars and officials.

            Father Fernández – a Dominican who was a friend of Isagani.
            Following the incident with the posters, he invited Isagani to a
            dialogue, not so much as a teacher with his student but as a friar
            with a Filipino. Although they failed to resolve their differences,
            they each promised to approach their colleagues with the opposing
            views from the other party – although both feared that given the
            animosity that existed between their sides, their own compatriots
            may not believe in the other party's existence.

            Capitán Tiago – Don Santiago de los Santos. María Clara's father.
            Having several landholdings in Pampanga, Binondo, and Laguna, as
            well as taking ownership of the Ibarras' vast estate, Tiago still
            fell into depression following María's entry into the convent. He
            alleviated this by smoking opium, which quickly became an
            uncontrolled vice, exacerbated by his association with Padre Írene
            who regularly supplied him with the substance. Tiago hired Basilio
            as a capista, a servant who was given the opportunity to study as
            part of his wages; Basilio eventually pursued medicine and became
            his caregiver and the manager of his estate. Tiago died of shock
            upon hearing of Basilio's arrest and Padre Írene's embellished
            stories of violent revolt.

            Captain-General – the highest-ranking official in the Philippines
            during the Spanish colonial period. The Captain-General in the novel
            is Simoun's friend and confidant, and is described as having an
            insatiable lust for gold. Simoun met him as a major during the Ten
            Years' War in Cuba. He secured the major's friendship and promotion
            to Captain-General through bribes. When he was posted in the
            Philippines, Simoun used him as a pawn in his own power plays to
            drive the country into revolution. The Captain-General was shamed
            into not extending his tenure after being rebuked by a high official
            in the aftermath of Basilio's imprisonment.

            of Spanish, but was then also under pressure from the priests to
            protect their prerogatives as monopolizers of instruction. Some of
            the novel's most scathing criticism is reserved for Custodio, a
            Peninsular Spaniard portrayed as an opportunist who married his way
            into high society, who regularly criticized favored ideas that did
            not come from him, but was ultimately, laughably incompetent.

            Kabesang Tales – Telesforo Juan de Dios, a former cabeza de barangay
            of Barrio Sagpang in Tiani. He was a sugarcane planter who cleared
            lands he thought belonged to no one, losing his wife and eldest
            daughter in the endeavor. When the Dominicans took over his farm, he
            fought to his last money to have it retained in his possession.
            While his suit against the Dominicans was ongoing, he was kidnapped
            by bandits while he was out patrolling his fields. Having no money
            to pay his captors, his daughter Juli was forced to become a maid in
            exchange for her mistress paying his ransom. When his son Tano was
            conscripted into the Guardia Civil, again Tales had no money to pay
            for Tano's exclusion from the draft. When in spite of all Tales lost
            the case, he not only lost his farm but was also dealt with a heavy
            fine. He later joined the bandits and became one of their fiercest
            commanders. Tandang Selo, his father, would later on join his band
            after the death of Juli.

            the young, sick Basilio who was then fleeing from the Guardia Civil.
            On Christmas Day, when Juli left to be with her mistress, Selo
            suffered some form of stroke that impaired his ability to speak.
            After Juli's suicide, Selo left town permanently, taking with him
            his hunting spear. He was later seen with the bandits and was killed
            in an encounter with the Guardia Civil – ironically by the gun of
            the troops' sharpshooter Tano, his grandson.
