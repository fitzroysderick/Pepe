            - Jose Rizal's arrival in Manila on June 26, 1892 had become very
            sensational among the Filipinos. His popularity feared the
            Spaniards, and as such, paid careful attention to his every moves –
            all houses where he had been were searched and the Filipinos seen in
            his company were suspected. As he had planned, on July 3, 1892 he
            founded the La Liga Filipina in the house of Doroteo Ongjunco in
            Tondo, Manila.

            - Aboard the steamer Cebu and under heavy guard, Rizal left Manila,
            sailing to Mindoro and Panay, until he reached Dapitan at seven
            o'clock in the evening of June 17. From that day until July 31,
            1896, Dapitan became the bare witness to one of the most fruitful
            periods in Rizal's life. His stay in the province was more than “he”
            living in exile – it was the period when Rizal had been more focused
            on serving the people and the society through his civic works,
            medical practices, land development and promotion of education.

            - In Dapitan, Rizal had a scholarly debate with Father Pablo
            Pastells regarding religion. This exchange of heated arguments
            revealed the anti-Christian Rizal – his bitterness on the abuses
            performed by friars, doing such under the name of the sacred
            religion. Father Pastells tried his best to win Rizal back to the
            faith but fortunately or unfortunately, in vain. These series of
            debate ended inconclusively in which neither of them convinced the
            other of his judgments/arguments.

            - Rizal had maximized his stay in Dapitan by devoting much of his
            time in improving his artistic and literary skills; doing
            agricultural and civic projects; engaging in business activities,
            and writing letters to his friends in Europe, particularly to
            Ferdinand Blumentritt and Reinhold Rost. His careers and
            achievements in different fields were as follows:

            - As a physician, Rizal provided free medicine to his patients, most
            of them were underprivileged. However, he also had wealthy patients
            who paid him well enough for his excellent surgical skill. Among
            them were Don Ignacio Tumarong who gave Rizal 3000 pesos for
            restoring his sight, an Englishman who gave him 500 pesos, and
            Aklanon haciendero, DonFrancisco Azcarraga, who paid him a cargo of
            sugar. His skill was put into test in August 1893 when his mother,
            Doña Teodora Alonzo, was placed under ophthalmic surgery for the
            third time. The operation was a success, however, Alonzo ignored her
            son's instructions and removed the bandages in her eyes which lead
            to irritation and infection.

            - As an engineer, Rizal applied his knowledge through the waterworks
            system he constructed in Dapitan. Going back to his academic life,
            Rizal obtained the title of expert surveyor (perito agrimensor) from
            the Ateneo Municipal. From his practical knowledge as an agrimensor,
            he widened his knowledge by reading engineering-related books. As a
            result, despite the inadequacy of tools at hand, he successfully
            provided a good water system in the province.

            - As an educator, Rizal established a school in Dapitan which was
            attended by 16 young boys from prominent families. Instead of
            charging them for the matriculation, he made the students do
            community projects for him like maintaining his garden and field. He
            taught them reading, writing in English and Spanish, geography,
            history, mathematics, industrial work, nature study, morals and
            gymnastics. He encouraged his students to engage in sports
            activities to strengthen their bodies as well. There was no formal
            room, like the typical classroom nowadays. Classes were conducted
            from 2 p.m to 4 p.m. with the teacher sitting on a hammock while the
            students sat on a long bamboo bench.

            - As an agriculturist, Rizal devoted time in planting important
            crops and fruit-bearing trees in his 16-hectare land (later,
            reaching as large as 70 hectares). He planted cacao,
            coffee,sugarcane, and coconuts, among many others. He even invested
            part of his earnings from being a medical practitioner and his
            6000-peso winnings from a lottery on lands. From the United States,
            he imported agricultural machinery and introduced to the native
            farmers of Dapitan the modern agricultural methods. Rizal also
            visualized having an agricultural colony in Sitio Ponot, within the
            Sindañgan Bay. He believed that the area was suitable for
            cattle-raising and for cash-crops as the area had abundant water.
            Unfortunately, this plan did not materialize.

            - As a businessman, the adventurous Rizal, with his partner, Ramon
            Carreon, tried his luck in the fishing, hemp and copra industries.
            In a letter to his brother-in-law, Manuel T. Hidalgo, he pointed out
            the potential of the fishing industry in the province (as the area
            was abundant with fish and good beaches). He also requested that two
            good Calamba fishermen be sent to Dapitan to teach the fisher folks
            of the new fishing methods, using a big net called pukutan. But the
            industry in which Rizal became more successful was in hemp, shipping
            the said product to a foreign firm in Manila.

            - As an inventor, little was known of Rizal. In 1887, during his
            medical practice in Calamba, he invented a special type of lighter
            called sulpukan which he sent to Blumentritt as a gift. According to
            Rizal, the wooden lighter's mechanism was based on the principle of
            compressed air. Another of his inventions was the wooden brick-maker
            can manufacture about 6,000 bricks a day.

            - As an artist, he had contributed his talent to the Sisters of
            Charity who were preparing for the arrival of the image of the Holy
            Virgin. Rizal was actually the person who modeled the image's right
            foot and other details. He also conceptualized its curtain, which
            was oil-painted by a Sister under his instruction. He also made
            sketches of anything which attracted him in Dapitan. Among his
            collections were the three rare fauna species that he discovered
            (dragon/lizard, frog and beetle) and the fishes he caught. He also
            sculpted the statuette called “The Mother's Revenge” which
            represented his dog, Syria, avenging her puppy to a crocodile which
            killed it.

            - As a linguist, Rizal was interested in the languages used in
            Dapitan, thus, studied and made comparisons of the Bisayan and
            Malayan languages existing in the region. In fact, Rizal had
            knowledge in 22 languages: Tagalog, Ilocano, Bisayan, Subanun,
            Spanish, Latin, Greek, English, French, German, Arabic, Malayan,
            Hebrew, Sanskrit, Dutch, Catalan, Italian, Chinese, Japanes,
            Portuguese, Swedish and Russian.

            - As a scientist, Rizal shared his interest with nature to his
            students. With his boys, they explored the jungles and searched for
            specimens which he sent to museums in Europe, particularly in the
            Dressed Museum. In return, scientific books and surgical instruments
            were delivered to him from the European scientists. He also did a
            bulk of other research and studies in the fields of ethnography,
            archaeology, geology, anthropology and geography. However, Rizal's
            most significant contribution in the scientific world was his
            discovery of three species:

            - Rizal also partakes in civic works in Dapitan. Upon arriving in
            the province, he noticed its poor condition. He drained the marshes
            of Dapitan to get rid of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. He also
            provided lighting systems coconut oil lamps posted in dark streets
            in the province out of what he earned from being a physician. He
            beautified Dapitan by remodeling the town plaza, with the aid of his
            Jesuit teacher, Fr. Francisco Sanchez, and created a relief map of
            Mindanao (footnote: using stones, soil and grass) right in front of
            the church.

            Leonor Rivera's death. Not soon, to his surprise, an Irish girl

            Josephine Bracken who, to Wenceslao Retana's words, was “slender, a
            chestnut blond, with blue eyes, dressed with elegant simplicity,
            with an atmosphere of light (gaiety).”

            blind foster father, George Taufer, and a Filipina named Manuela
            Orlac. Rizal's fame as an ophthalmic surgeon reached overseas, and
            one of Rizal's friends, Julio Llorente referred the group to Rizal.
            Rizal and Bracken instantly fell in love with each and in just one
            month, they agreed to marry which appalled and disturbed Taufer.
            However, the parish priest of Dapitan, Father Pedro Obach, refused
            to do so unless they were permitted by the Bishop of Cebu.

            no priest was willing to marry the two, the couple exchanged their
            vows before God in their own way, which scandalized Fr. Obach. In
            1896, their love bore its fruit – Josephine was pregnant.
            Unfortunately, Bracken gave birth to a one-month premature baby boy
            who lived only for three hours. The child was buried in Dapitan,
            bearing the name Francisco, after Rizal's father.

            - Prior to the outbreak of the revolution, the Katipunan leader,
            Andres Bonifacio, sought the advice of Jose Rizal. In a secret
            meeting on May 2, 1896 at Bitukang Manok river in Pasig, the group
            agreed to send Dr. Pio Valenzuela as a representative to Dapitan who
            will inform Rizal of their plan to launch a revolution against the
            Spaniards. On board the steamer Venus, Valenzuala left Manila on
            June 15, 1892 and in 6 days, arrived at Dapitan with a blind
            companion, Raymundo Mata. At night, Rizal and Valenzuela had a talk
            in the former's garden. There, Valenzuela told him of the
            Katipunan's plan. Regarding this, Rizal outspokenly objected
            Bonifacio's “premature” idea for two reasons:

            During the peak of the Cuban revolution, Rizal offered his services
            as a military doctor to compromise with the shortage of physicians
            in the said country. It was his friend Ferdinand Blumentritt who
            informed him of the situation in Cuba and suggested that he
            volunteer himself as army doctor. On December 17, 1895, Rizal sent a
            letter to Governor General Ramon Blanco rendering his service for
            Cuba. But for months Rizal waited in vain for the governor's reply,
            and lost hope that his request would be granted. It was only on July
            30, 1896 when Rizal received a letter from Governor Blanco, dated
            July 2, 1896, accepting his offer. The letter also stated that Rizal
            will be given a pass so that he can go to Manila, then to Spain
            where its Minister of War will assign him to the Army of Operations
            in Cuba.

            Rizal was supposed to board the Isla de Luzon for Spain, but

            the vicinity but was allowed to accept visitors so long as they were
            his immediate family. Of course, all these delays were part of the
            drama – Rizal has now fallen to the critical/deadly Spanish trap.

            - In front of the church, Rizal and Father Sanchez made a huge
            relief map of Mindanao out of earth, stones and grass. This map
            still adorns the town plaza of Dapitan. This artistic manifestation
            of a well-lived exile was made by Dr. Jose P. Rizal in August 1892
            based on the map done by Fr. Pedro Murillo Velarde, a French Jesuit
            in 1752. He was assisted by Fr. Francisco Paula de Sanchez, S.J.,
            his favorite teacher at the Ateneo de Manila where he studied in
            1872-1877. Rizal used this map as a motivating device in teaching
            geography and history to his pupils during his lonely but productive
            banishment in Dapitan from July 17, 1892 to July 31, 1896.

            - St. James Church is located across the Relief Map of Mindanao, and
            used to be Rizal's place of worship. The hero used to pray in a
            corner at the back of the church to avoid the eyes of the judgmental
            friars who constantly hinted at him during their sermons.

            - Standing in the spot where Rizal used to stand during masses, one
            can behold this view inside the church. "On this spot of Saint James
            Church constructed by the Jesuits in 1871, Jose Rizal stood while
            hearing mass every Sunday during his exile in Dapitan in 1892-1896."

            - Rizal affected the construction of the house to accommodate the
            growing number of pupils in his Talisay School. The area underneath
            the hut served as the workshop of his pupils (Inscription). His
            exile to Dapitan gave Rizal the opportunity to put into practice his
            educational ideas. In 1893 he established a school which existed
            until the end of his exile in July 1896. It began with three pupils
            and in the course of time the enrollment increased to 16 and later
            to 21. Instead of charging tuition fees, he made them work in his
            garden, fields, and construction projects in the community.

            - The octagonal hut served as Rizal's clinic and as dormitory of
            some of his pupils. Reconstructed with similar materials as the main
            house, it now stands as a reminder of the numerous medications
            performed by Rizal during his exile in Dapitan.

            from the high rocks; I see the seashore... In the square house we
            live, my mother, sister Trinidad, a nephew and I" - Rizal.
