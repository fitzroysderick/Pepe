            - While the ship was anchored at the Manila Bay, the Katipuneros
            hatched a plan to rescue Rizal. In executing the plot, Emilio
            Jacinto, Guillermo Masangkay and other Katipuneros disguised
            themselves as sailors. Using the boat named Caridad, the group was
            able to go near the ship, confronted Kizal and informed him of their
            intention. However, Rizal declined. He refused the idea of him
            getting rescued. He stated that he was aware of what he was doing.

            transferred to the steamer Castilla while: waiting for the ship Isla
            de Panay that would take him to Barcelona.
