            - Mi último adiós (English: "My Last Farewell") is a poem written by
            Filipino propagandist and writer Dr. José Rizal before his execution
            by firing squad on December 30, 1896. The piece was one of the last
            notes he wrote before his death. Another that he had written was
            found in his shoe, but because the text was illegible, its contents
            remain a mystery.

            - Rizal did not ascribe a title to his poem. Mariano Ponce, his
            friend and fellow reformist, titled it "Mi último pensamiento" ("My
            Last Thought") in the copies he distributed, but this did not catch
            on. Also, the "coconut oil lamp" containing the poem was not
            delivered to the Rizal's family until after the execution as it was
            required to light the cell.

            - "On the afternoon of Dec. 29, 1896, a day before his execution,
            Dr. José Rizal was visited by his mother, Teodora Alonzo; sisters
            Lucia, Josefa, Trinidád, Maria and Narcisa; and two nephews. When
            they took their leave, Rizal told Trinidád in English that there was
            something in the small alcohol stove (cocinilla), as opposed to
            saying coconut oil lamp (lamparilla), which was intended to provide
            cover for the transportation of the text. The stove was given to
            Narcisa by the guard when the party was about to board their
            carriage in the courtyard. At home, the Rizal ladies recovered a
            folded paper from the stove. On it was written an unsigned, untitled
            and undated poem of 14 five-line stanzas. The Rizals reproduced
            copies of the poem and sent them to Rizal's friends in the country
            and abroad. In 1897, Mariano Ponce in Hong Kong had the poem printed
            with the title "Mí último pensamiento". Fr. Mariano Dacanay, who
            received a copy of the poem while a prisoner in Bilibid (jail),
            published it in the first issue of La Independencia on September 25,
            1898 with the title 'Ultimo Adios'.

            Farewell, my adored Land, region of the sun caressed, Pearl of the
            Orient Sea, our Eden lost, With gladness I give you my life, sad and
            repressed; And were it more brilliant, more fresh and at its best, I
            would still give it to you for your welfare at most.

            On the fields of battle, in the fury of fight, Others give you their

            laurel, lily white; Scaffold, open field, conflict or martyrdom's
            site, It is the same if asked by the home and country.

            I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to show And at last announce
            the day, after a gloomy night; If you need a hue to dye your
            matutinal glow, Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so,
            And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light.

            My dreams, when scarcely a lad adolescent, My dreams when already a
            youth, full of vigor to attain, Were to see you, Gem of the Sea of
            the Orient, Your dark eyes dry, smooth brow held to a high plane,
            Without frown, without wrinkles and of shame without stain.

            soul to you, that will soon part from thee; Hail! How sweet 'tis to
            fall that fullness you may acquire; To die to give you life, 'neath
            your skies to expire, And in thy mystic land to sleep through
            eternity!.

            If over my tomb some day, you would see blow, A simple humble flow'r
            amidst thick grasses, Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so,
            And under the cold tomb, I may feel on my brow, Warmth of your
            breath, a whiff of thy tenderness.

            Let the moon with soft, gentle light me descry, Let the dawn send
            forth its fleeting, brilliant light, In murmurs grave allow the wind

            bird int one a song of peace o'er my site.

            return pure to the sky; Let a friend shed tears over my early
            demise; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high, Pray
            too, oh, my Motherland, that in God may rest I.
