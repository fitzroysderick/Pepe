        <Text>
          Rizal’s first essay, “The Love of Country,” was written when he was 21
          and newly arrived in Madrid. It was published under the name of “Laong
          Laan'' on 20 August 1882 in Diariong Tagalog.” A Philippine newspaper,
          then on 31 October 1890 in La Solidaridad, Madrid.

          This essay is a poignant dissertation of what Rizal calls a “beautiful
          but hackneyed subject,” love of country. In crystallizing his concept
          of love of country, Rizal reveals a foretaste of the style and
          substance of his novels. He could have had Maria Clara and Sisa when
          described the country as “enveloped in morning clouds and mist, always
          beautiful and poetic, and the more idolized by her sons when they are
          absent and far away from her. "Love of a country is the purest, most
          heroic and most sublime human sentiment. It is gratitude, it is
          affection for everything that reminds us of something of the first
          days of our life; it is the land where our ancestors are sleeping.
          Love of country is never effaced once it has penetrated the heart,
          because it carries with it a divine stamp which renders it eternal and
          imperishable. Of all loves, that of country is the greatest, the most
          heroic and the most disinterested. Some have sacrificed for her their
          youth, their pleasures. Others have dedicated to her the splendors of
          their genius others shed their blood all have died, bequeathing to
          their Motherland an immense future: liberty and glory.

          This idea of dying for the country reverberated in Rizal’s writings.
          In a letter to Mariano Ponce, he declared: If one has to die, at least
          one must die in his own country, by his country and for his country. A
          year later, Rizal decided to return to the Philippines, the first step
          that would ultimately lead to his death for the country: I believe
          that it is now the opportune time for me to return to the Philippines
          and share with them all the dangers. For I have always been of the
          opinion that I can do more in my country than abroad. What good have I
          done in these three years, and what evil had occurred because I was in
          my country. "Rizal's Love for the Motherland our national hero, Jose
          Rizal, loved his country deeply. He had been to free, lovely,
          prosperous, and developed nations, yet he always preferred to return
          to his own. Love of country, the native land, the motherland, and the
          land of birth – this was the very character that defined his
          personality. He was about 21 years old when he went to Spain for the
          first time in May 1882. While traveling, he recorded in his diary that
          his motherland was the seat of all his affection and that he loved it
          that no matter how beautiful Europe would be, he would still like to
          go back to her (Reminiscences and Travels of Jose Rizal, Centennial
          Edition, Manila: Jose Rizal National Centennial Commission, 1961).

          Here is a beautiful subject, and because it is beautiful, it is very
          back eyed. Learned man, poet, artist, laborer, merchant, or soldier,
          old or young, king or slave- all have pondered it and devoted to it
          the most valued fruits of their intelligence, or of their hearts. From
          the cultured European, free, and proud of his glorious history, to the
          African Negro dragged out of his forests and sold for a paltry sum;
          from ancient peoples whose shadows still hover over their somber
          ruins-the tombs of their glories and sufferings-to the modern nations,
          full of activity and life, all, all have had and have an idol whom
          they call Motherland-beautiful, brilliant, sublime but implacable,
          haughty, and exacting. A thousand tongues have sung to her, a thousand
          lyres have offered her their most sonorous music; the most favored
          intellect have displayed before her memory, their most resplendent
          fineries. She has been the universal cry of peace, of love, and of
          glory because she is in the hearts and minds of all men, and like the
          light enclosed in limpid crystal, she goes forth in the form of the
          most intense splendors.

          And will this be an obstacle to us who wish to treat of her? And can
          we not dedicate to her something, we whose only sin is to have been
          born later? Would the XIXth century serve as an excuse for us to be
          ungrateful? No. The rich mine of the heart has not yet been exhausted.
          Her remembrance is always prolific, and no matter how little
          inspiration we have, positively we will find in the bottom of our
          soul, if not a rich treasure, a mite, poor but an enthusiastic
          manifestation of our sentiments. In the manner then of the ancient
          Hebrews who offered in the temple the first fruits of their love, we
          in foreign land will dedicate our first utterances to our country,
          enveloped in morning clouds and mist, always beautiful and poetic, and
          the more idolized by her sons when they are absent and far away from
          her.

          And this is not surprising, because it is a very natural feeling;
          because there in our country are first memories of childhood, a merry
          ode, known only in childhood, from whose races spring forth the flower
          of innocence and happiness; because there slumbers a whole past and a
          future can be hoped, because in her forests and in her meadows, on
          every tree, on every blade, on every flower you see engraved the
          memory of a being you love, as her breath in the perfumed breeze, her
          song in the murmur of the fountain, her smile in the rainbow of the
          sky, or her sighs in the confused moans of the night wind.

          It is because you see there with the eyes of your imagination, under
          the tranquil roof of your old home, a family who remembers you and
          awaits you, thinking of you and worrying about you; in short because
          in her sky, in her sun, in her seas, and in her forests, you find
          poetry, tenderness, and love and even in the cemetery there is a
          humble tomb awaiting you to return you to the soil. Will there be a
          genie who will bind your heart to the soil of our native country, who
          beautifies and adorns everything, showing us all objects in a poetic
          and sentimental aspect and captivating our hearts. Because under
          whatever aspect she may appear, whether she is dressed in purple,
          crowned with flowers and laurels, powerful and rich; whether she is
          sorrowful and solitary, clad in rags and a slave, entreating her slave
          sons; whether she is a nymph in a pleasant garden beside the blue
          waves of the sea, gracious and beautiful as the dream of deluded
          youth; whether she is enveloped in a shroud of snow, sitting, fatidic
          ally on the ends of the earth under a sunless and starless sky;
          whatever her name, her age, or her fortune might be, we love her
          always, as the child loves his mother even in the midst of hunger and
          misery,
        </Text>
        <Text>
          And how strange: The poorer and more wretched she is, the more one is
          willing to suffer for her, the more she is adored, the more one finds
          pleasure in bearing up with her. It has been observed that the people
          of the mountains and wild valleys and those born on barren and dismal
          land are the very ones who can remember more vividly their country,
          finding in the cities a terrible boredom which compels them to return
          to their native land. Is it because love of country is the purest,
          most heroic, and most sublime human sentiment? It is gratitude; it is
          affection for everything that reminds us of something of the first
          days of our life; it is the land where our ancestors are sleeping; it
          is the temple where we have worshipped God with the candor of babbling
          childhood; it is the sound of the church bell which has delighted us
          since a child; they are the vast fields, the blue lake, the
          picturesque banks of the river which we pass by in a nimble boat; the
          limpid brook which laves the cheerful little house nestling among
          flowers like a love-nest; or the tall mountain which inspire us this
          pleasant sentiment? Will it be the raging storm that lashes, and
          knocks down everything it finds on its way; the lightning which,
          escaping from the hands of the Almighty annihilates everything; will
          it be the avalanche or cascade, matters of perpetual motion and
          endless menace? Is it all this that attracts, captivates, and entices
          us?.{" "}

        <Text>
          Probably these beauties or tender remembrances fortify the tie that
          unites us to our native land, engendering a pleasant feeling of
          wellbeing when we are in our country, or deep melancholy when we are
          far away from her, the origin of a cruel disease called nostalgia.

          Oh! Never sadden the stranger who arrives at your shores; do not
          awaken in him that vivid memory of his country, the comforts of his
          home, because then you will evoke this sickness, tenacious phantom
          that will not abandon him until he sees again his native land or he

          But, on the other hand, love of country is never effaced once it has

          It has been said that love has always been the most powerful force
          behind the most sublime actions. Well then, of all loves, that of
          country is the greatest, the most heroic and the most disinterested.
          Read history, if not, the annals, the traditions. Go to the homes,
          what sacrifices, self-denial and tears are held on the sacred altar of
          the nation. From Brutus, who condemned his sons charged with treason,
          to Guzman the Good who allowed his son to die in order not to fail in
          his duty, what dramas, what tragedies what martyrdom have not been
          enacted for the welfare of that inexorable divinity who has nothing to
          give you in return for your children but gratitude and blessings! And
          notwithstanding, with the pieces of their hearts they raise glorious
          monuments to their motherland; with the work of their hands, with the
          sweat of their brow, they have sprinkled and made fruitful her sacred
          tree, and neither have they expected nor received any reward.

          See there a man sunk in his study. For him his best days are passing

          truth; he solves a problem; hunger and thirst, cold and heat; sickness
          and misfortune have successively confronted him. He is going down his
          grave and avails of his agony to offer to his motherland a rosette for
          her crown, a truth- fountain and origin of a thousand benefits.

          The motherland is in danger! Soldiers and leaders as if by charm

          their parents and all rush to defend their common mother. They bid
          farewell to the quiet pleasures of the home and hide under their
          helmets the tears that tenderness draws. They all leave and die.
          Perhaps he is the father of many children, fair and pinkish like
          cherubs; perhaps he is a young man of smiling hopes- a son or a
          lover-it does not matter. He has defended the one who gave him life he
          has fulfilled his duty. Peter or Leonides, whoever he might be, the

            - Noli Me Tángere (Latin for "Touch Me Not") is a novel by Filipino
            writer and activist José Rizal and was published during the Spanish
            colonial period of the Philippines. It explores inequities in law
            and practice in terms of the treatment by the ruling government and
            the Spanish Catholic friars of the resident peoples in the late-19th
            century.

            - Originally written by Rizal in Spanish, the book has since been
            more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either
            Tagalog (the major indigenous language), or English. The Rizal Law
            requires Noli and its sequel, El filibusterismo, to be read by all
            high school students throughout the country. Noli is studied in
            Grade 9 and El filibusterismo in Grade 10. The two novels are widely
            considered to be the national epic of the Philippines. They have
            been adapted in many forms, such as operas, musicals, plays, and
            other forms of art.

            - The title originates from the Biblical passage John 20:13-17. In
            Rizal's time, it also referred to cancers that occurred on the face,
            particularly cancers of the eyelid; touching such lesions irritated
            them, causing pain. As an ophthalmologist, Rizal was familiar with
            the cancer and the name. He is explicit about the connection in the
            novel's dedication, which begins: A mi patria ('To my country') and
            continues with a cancer of such malignant a character that the least
            touch irritates it and awakens in it the sharpest pains. Rizal
            probes the cancers of Filipino society. Early English translations
            of the novel used different titles, such as An Eagle Flight (1900)
            and The Social Cancer (1912), but more recent English translations
            use the original title.

            - Rizal intended to express the way Filipino culture was perceived
            to be backward, anti-progress, anti-intellectual, and not conducive
            to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. At the time, he was a
            student of medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid.

            - Other Filipinos were also working or studying in Madrid which, as
            the capital of Spain, was the center of culture and universities. At
            a gathering on January 2, 1884, of friends at the house of Pedro A.
            Paterno, Rizal proposed that a group of Filipinos should collaborate
            on a novel about the Philippines. His proposal was unanimously
            approved by those present, among whom were Pedro, Máximo Viola and
            Antonio Paterno, Graciano López Jaena, Evaristo Aguirre, Eduardo de
            Lete, Julio Llorente, and Valentin Ventura. However, they never got
            into the project. Although agreeing to help, none of the others
            wrote anything. Initially, Rizal planned for the novel to encompass
            all phases of Filipino life, but most of his friends, all young
            males, wanted to write about women. Rizal saw that his companions
            spent more time gambling and flirting with Spanish women than
            writing. Because of this, he decided to draft the novel alone.

            - Crisóstomo Ibarra, the mestizo son of the recently deceased Don
            Rafael Ibarra, is returning to San Diego town in Laguna after seven
            years of study in Europe. Kapitán Tiago, a family friend, invites
            him to a reunion party in Manila. At the party, Crisóstomo meets
            Padre Dámaso who was San Diego's parish priest when Crisóstomo left
            for Europe. Dámaso treats Crisóstomo with hostility, to the surprise
            of the young man who regarded the priest as his father's friend.
            Later, as Crisóstomo was walking back to his hotel, Lieutenant
            Guevara, another friend of his father, informs him that Don Rafael
            may have been killed for political reasons and Dámaso may have been
            involved. Guevara warns him to be careful.

            - The following day, Crisóstomo returns to Tiago's home to meet with
            his childhood sweetheart, Tiago's daughter María Clara. As the two
            flirt and reminisce, María reads back to him a part of his farewell
            letter on his discussion with his father about the state of the
            country. Ibarra excuses himself eventually as it was time to go to
            San Diego.

            - Arriving in San Diego, Crisóstomo goes to the cemetery and finds
            his father's grave desecrated. He seeks out the gravedigger who then
            tells him that the parish priest had ordered Don Rafael's remains
            transferred to the Chinese cemetery, but that he threw the corpse
            into the lake instead out of fear and pity. At that moment, the
            town's new parish priest, Padre Bernardo Salví, passes by wherein an
            enraged Crisóstomo pushes him to the ground, demanding an
            explanation; a fearful Salví states that he was only newly assigned
            to the town but reveals that Padre Dámaso ordered the transfer.

            - Crisóstomo decides to forgive and commits to improvements in his
            town. He plans to build a private school, believing that his
            paisanos would benefit from a more modern education than what is
            offered in the government schools, which were under the influence of
            the friars. Enjoying widespread support from the locals and Spanish
            authorities, Crisóstomo's project advances quickly. He receives
            counsel from Don Anastacio, a local philosopher, and recruits a
            progressive schoolmaster. Construction was set to begin shortly with
            the cornerstone to be laid in a few weeks during San Diego's town
            fiesta.

            the shores of the Laguna de Baý. They discover that a crocodile had
            been lurking in the Ibarras' fish pens. The boatman jumps into the
            water with a knife drawn. Crisóstomo follows him and the two subdue
            the animal together. Elías, the boatman, proclaims himself indebted
            to Crisóstomo.

            - On the day of the fiesta, Elías warns Crisóstomo of a plot to kill
            him at the cornerstone ceremony. Sure enough, Crisóstomo evades
            injury and the would-be assassin is killed. During the luncheon, an
            uninvited Padre Dámaso further berates Crisóstomo. The other guests
            hiss for discretion, but Dámaso carries on and insults the memory of
            Don Rafael. Crisóstomo then loses control, strikes the friar
            unconscious and holds a knife to his neck. Crisóstomo tells the
            guests about Dámaso's schemes that resulted in his father's death,
            but releases Dámaso when María Clara pleads for mercy. Crisóstomo is
            excommunicated from the Church, but has it lifted in Manila through
            the intercession of the sympathetic captain-general. Returning to
            San Diego, he finds María ill and refuses to see him.

            - Meanwhile, Elías senses Crisóstomo's influence with the government
            and takes him for a sail so they can talk in private. Elías reveals
            that a revolutionary group had been trying to recruit him but he
            stalled in order to get Crisóstomo's views first. The conversation
            shifts to Elías' family history. It turns out that Elías'
            grandfather, in his youth, worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila
            office, but one night a fire consumes the office and the Spanish
            proprietor accuses him of arson. He was prosecuted and jailed; upon
            release, he was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker.
            His wife turned to prostitution to support the family. Their lives
            were ruined.

            - Crisóstomo says that he cannot help and his school project is his
            focus. Rebuffed, Elías advices Crisóstomo to avoid him in the
            future, for his own safety. However, Elías returns a few days later
            to tell him of a rogue uprising planned for that same night. The
            instigators had used Crisóstomo's name in vain to recruit
            malcontents. The authorities know of the uprising and are prepared
            to spring a trap on the rebels. Realizing the scheme's
            repercussions, Crisóstomo abandons his school project and enlists
            Elías in sorting out and destroying documents that may implicate
            him. Elías obliges, but comes across a name familiar to him: Don
            Pedro Eibarramendia. Crisóstomo says Pedro was his great-grandfather
            and that they had to shorten his long family name. Elías responds
            that Eibarramendia was the same Spaniard who accused his grandfather
            of arson, and thus condemned Elías and his family to misfortune.
            Elias leaves the house in consternation.

            The following morning, the instigators are found dead—Padre Salví,
            the mastermind of the uprising, ordered his senior sexton to kill
            them in order to silence them. Meanwhile, Elias sneaks back into the
            Ibarra mansion and sorts through documents and valuables, then burns
            down the house. Crisóstomo and his co-accused are loaded into horse
            carts and taken to prison with their townmates shouting in anger and
            casting stones as they pass.

            - Kapitán Tiago later on hosts a dinner at his riverside house in
            Manila to celebrate María Clara's engagement with Alfonso Linares, a
            Peninsular who was presented as her new suitor following
            Crisóstomo's excommunication. Present at the party were Padre Salví,
            Padre Sibyla, Lieutenant Guevarra, and other acquaintances. They
            spoke of the events in San Diego and Crisóstomo's fate. Salví, who
            lusted after María Clara all along and staged the uprising in order
            to frame Crisóstomo, says he requested to be moved to the Convent of
            the Poor Clares in Manila under the pretense of the San Diego
            uprising being too much for him.

            - Guevara outlines how the court came to condemn Crisóstomo. In a
            signed letter he wrote before leaving for Europe, Crisóstomo spoke
            of his father, an alleged rebel who died in prison. Somehow this
            letter fell into the hands of an enemy, and Crisóstomo's handwriting
            was copied to create recruitment letters for the uprising. The
            signature on the letters was similar to Crisóstomo's seven years
            before, but not to the present day. Crisóstomo only had to deny
            ownership of the signature on the original letter and the case built
            on the bogus letters would be dismissed. But upon seeing the letter,
            which was of course his farewell letter to María Clara, Crisóstomo
            lost the will to fight the charges, and he was sentenced to be
            deported. Guevara then approaches María who had been listening.
            Privately but sorrowfully, he congratulates her for her common sense
            in yielding the letter. Now, she can live a life of peace. María is
            devastated.

            - Later that evening Crisóstomo, having escaped prison with the help
            of Elías, confronts María in secret. María admits giving up his
            letter because Salví found Dámaso's old letters in the San Diego
            parsonage, letters from María's mother who was then pregnant with
            her and begging Dámaso for an abortion. It turns out that Dámaso was
            María's biological father. Salví promised not to divulge Dámaso's
            letters in exchange for Crisóstomo's farewell letter. Crisóstomo
            forgives her, María swears her undying love, and they part with a
            kiss.

            - Crisóstomo and Elías slip unnoticed through the Estero de Binondo
            and into the Pasig River. Elías tells Crisóstomo that his family
            treasure is buried at the Ibarra forest in San Diego. Wishing to
            make restitution, Crisóstomo tells Elías to flee with him to a
            foreign country where they will live as brothers. Elías declines,
            stating that his fate lies with the country he wishes to reform.
            Crisóstomo then tells him of his own desire for revolution to
            lengths that even Elías was unwilling to go. Just then, sentries
            catch up with their boat at the mouth of the Pasig River and pursue
            them across Laguna de Bay. Elías orders Crisóstomo to lie down and
            to meet him at his family's mausoleum in the forest. Elías then
            jumps into the water to distract the pursuers and is shot several
            times.

            Dámaso that her wedding with Linares be canceled and that she be
            entered into the cloister, or the grave. Seeing her resolution,
            Dámaso admits he ruined Crisóstomo because he was a mere mestizo and
            Dámaso wanted María to be happy and secure, and that was possible
            only if she married a peninsular Spaniard. Knowing why Salví had
            earlier requested to be assigned to the Convent of the Poor Clares,
            Dámaso pleads with María to reconsider, but to no avail. Weeping,
            Dámaso consents, knowing the horrible fate that awaits his daughter
            within the convent but finding it more tolerable than her suicide.

            - A few nights later in the Ibarra forest, a boy pursues his mother
            through the darkness. The woman went insane with the constant
            beating of her husband, the death of her younger son in the hands of
            Padre Salví, and the loss of her elder son to the Guardia Civil.
            Basilio, the boy, catches up with Sisa, his mother, inside the
            Ibarra mausoleum, but the strain had already been too great for
            Sisa. She dies in Basilio's embrace. As Basilio grieves for his
            mother, Elías stumbles into the mausoleum, himself dying from his
            wounds. He instructs Basilio to cremate their bodies and if no one
            comes, to dig inside the mausoleum, where he will find treasures,
            which he is to use for his own education.

            whispers that he will die without seeing the dawn of freedom for his
            people, and that those who see it must welcome it and not forget
            those who died in the darkness. Upon returning, Basilio encounters
            Ibarra also mourning for Elias. The two build a pyre for them before
            burying their remains. Following the funeral, Ibarra and Basilio dig
            the mausoleum for the treasures, which the latter receives a share
            of. Before letting Basilio leave, Ibarra re-echoes Elias' dying
            advice on the use of the treasures to the boy.

            depression, became addicted to opium and faded to obscurity. Salví,
            while waiting for his consecration as a bishop, serves as chaplain
            of the Convent of the Poor Clares. Meanwhile, during a stormy
            evening in September, two patrolmen reported seeing a specter on the
            roof of the convent weeping in despair. The next day, a government
            representative visited the convent to try to investigate the
            previous night's events. One of the nuns had a wet and torn gown and
            with tears told the representative of "tales of horror" and begged
            for "protection against the outrages of hypocrisy" (strongly
            suggesting that Padre Salví regularly rapes her when he is in the
            convent). The abbess, however, said that she was mad. A general also
            attempted to investigate the nun's case but by then, the abbess
            prohibited visits to the convent. Nothing more was said about this
            nun, or for that matter, María Clara.

            - Rizal depicted nationality by emphasizing the positive qualities
            of Filipinos: the devotion of a Filipina and her influence on a
            man's life, the deep sense of gratitude, and the solid common sense
            of the Filipinos under the Spanish regime.

            - The work was instrumental in creating a unified Filipino national
            identity and consciousness, as many natives previously identified
            with their respective regions. It lampooned, caricatured and exposed
            various elements in colonial society. Two characters in particular
            have become classics in Filipino culture: María Clara, who has
            become a personification of the ideal Filipino woman, loving and
            unwavering in her loyalty to her spouse; and the priest Father
            Dámaso, who reflects the covert fathering of illegitimate children
            by members of the Spanish clergy.

        <View className="flex-row space-x-2 ml-4">

            - The book indirectly influenced the Philippine Revolution of
            independence from the Spanish Empire, even though Rizal actually
            advocated direct representation to the Spanish government and an
            overall larger role for the Philippines within Spain's political
            affairs. In 1956, Congress passed Republic Act 1425, more popularly
            known as the Rizal Law, which requires all levels in Philippine
            schools to teach the novel as part of their curriculum. Noli Me
            Tángere is being taught to third-year secondary school (now Grade 9,
            due to the new K-12 curriculum) students, while its sequel El
            Filibusterismo is being taught for fourth-year secondary school (now
            Grade 10) students. The novels are incorporated into their study and
            survey of Philippine literature. Both of Rizal's novels were
            initially banned from Catholic educational institutions given its
            negative portrayal of the Church, but this taboo has been largely
            superseded as religious schools conformed to the Rizal Law.

            - "Hymn To Labor" is a patriotic and didactic poem that emphasizes
            the importance of labor in society. Unlike Rizal's earlier works
            that focused on romanticism and individualism, this poem celebrates
            the collective efforts of the Filipino people.

            - Its structure consists of a chorus and verses sung by men, wives,
            maidens, and children. Each group extols the virtues of labor and
            its role in supporting the motherland, family, and individual
            fulfillment. The language is simple and direct, conveying a clear
            message of national unity and the dignity of work.

        <View className="flex-row space-x-2 ml-4">
          <Text>
            - Indolence is the inclination to laziness or sloth. It is a
            socio-political essay published in La solidaridad in Madrid in 1890.
            It was written by José Rizal as a response to the accusation of
            Indio or Malay indolence, it's an exploratory essay that explains
            the alleged idleness of his people during the Spanish colonization.
            It is a study of the causes why the people did not, as was said,
            work hard during the Spanish regime.

            - Rizal says that an illness will worsen if the wrong treatment is
            given. The past writings on indolence revolve only on either denying
            or affirming, and never studying its causes in depth. Some writings
            even implies a notion that Filipinos are by nature indolent. He
            argued through his essay that even before the Spaniards arrived the
            early Filipinos were already carrying out trade within provinces and
            with other neighboring countries; they were also engaged in
            agriculture and mining; some natives even spoke Spanish. All this
            disproves the notion that Filipinos are by nature indolent. Rizal
            ends by asking what then would have caused Filipinos to forget their
            past.

            • The hot climate: Filipinos cannot be compared to Europeans who
            live in cold countries. Filipinos must exert much more effort at
            work because of this climate. An hour's work under the Philippine
            sun, he says, is equivalent to a day's work in temperate regions.

            • The establishment of the Galleon Trade cut off all previous
            associations of the Philippines with other countries in Asia and the
            Middle East. As a result, business was only conducted with Spain
            through Mexico. Because of this, the small businesses and handicraft
            industries that flourished during the pre-Spanish period gradually
            disappeared.

            • Spain extinguished the natives' love of work because of the
            implementation of forced labor. Because of the wars between Spain
            and other countries in Europe as well as the Muslims in Mindanao,
            the Filipinos were compelled to work in shipyards, roads, and other
            public works, abandoning agriculture, industry, and commerce.

            • Spain did not protect the people against foreign invaders and
            pirates. With no arms to defend themselves, the natives were killed,
            their houses burned, and their lands destroyed. As a result of this,
            the Filipinos were forced to become nomads, lost interest in
            cultivating their lands or in rebuilding the industries that were
            shut down, and simply became submissive to the mercy of God.

            no courses in Agriculture, Industry, etc., which were badly needed

        <View className="flex-row space-x-2 ml-4">
          <Text>
            - Jose Rizal was greatly impressed by the fighting spirit that the
            young women of Malolos had shown. In his letter, he expresses great
            joy and satisfaction over the battle they had fought. In this
            portion of Rizal's letter, it is obvious that his ultimate desire
            was for women to be offered the same opportunities as those received
            by men in terms of education. During those days young girls were not
            sent to school because of the universal notion that they would soon
            only be taken as wives and stay at home with the children. Rizal,
            however, emphasizes on freedom of thought and the right to
            education, which must be granted to both boys and girls alike.

            - Rizal stipulates a number of important points in this portion of

            however, is that whatever a mother shows to her children is what the
            children will become also. If the mother is always kissing the hand
            of the friars in submission, then her children will grow up to be
            sycophants and mindless fools who do nothing but do as they are
            told, even if the very nature of the task would violate their rights

            - El Filibusterismo (translate. The filibusterism; The Subversive or
            The Subversion, as in the Locsín English translation, are also
            possible translations), also known by its alternative English title
            The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine
            national hero José Rizal. It is the sequel to Noli Me Tángere and,
            like the first book, was written in Spanish. It was first published
            in 1891 in Ghent.

            - The novel centers on the Noli-El Fili duology's main character
            Crisóstomo Ibarra, now returning for vengeance as "Simoun". The
            novel's dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel's
            hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying Ibarra's resort to
            solving his country's issues through violent means, after his
            previous attempt in reforming the country's system made no effect
            and seemed impossible with the corrupt attitude of the Spaniards
            toward the Filipinos.

            - The novel, along with its predecessor, was banned in some parts of
            the Philippines as a result of their portrayals of the Spanish
            government's abuses and corruption. These novels, along with Rizal's
            involvement in organizations that aimed to address and reform the
            Spanish system and its issues, led to Rizal's exile to Dapitan and
            eventual execution. Both the novel and its predecessor, along with
            Rizal's last poem, are now considered Rizal's literary masterpieces.

            - Both of Rizal's novels had a profound effect on Philippine society
            in terms of views about national identity, the Catholic faith and
            its influence on the Filipino's choice, and the government's issues
            in corruption, abuse of power, and discrimination, and on a larger
            scale, the issues related to the effect of colonization on people's
            lives and the cause for independence. These novels later on
            indirectly became the inspiration to start the Philippine
            Revolution.

            - Throughout the Philippines, the reading of both the novel and its
            predecessor is now mandatory for high school students throughout the
            archipelago, although it is now read using English, Filipino, and
            the Philippines' regional languages.

            - In the events of the previous novel, Crisóstomo Ibarra, a
            reform-minded mestizo who tried to establish a modern school in his
            hometown of San Diego and marry his childhood sweetheart, was
            falsely accused of rebellion and presumed dead after a shootout
            following his escape from prison. Elías, his friend who was also a
            reformer, sacrificed his life to give Crisóstomo a chance to regain
            his treasure and flee the country, and hopefully continue their
            crusade for reforms from abroad. After a thirteen-year absence from
            the country, a more revolutionary Crisóstomo has returned, having
            taken the identity of Simoun, a mysterious wealthy jeweler whose
            objective is to drive the government to commit as much abuse as
            possible in order to drive people into revolution.

            - Simoun goes from town to town presumably to sell his jewels.
            Reaching San Diego, he detours to the Ibarras' forested land to
            retrieve more of his treasures buried in the mausoleum. There, his
            true identity as Crisóstomo Ibarra is discovered by a now-grown
            Basilio, who was also in the mausoleum visiting his mother's grave.
            In the years since the death of his mother, Basilio had been serving
            as Capitán Tiago's servant in exchange for being allowed to study,
            and is now an aspiring doctor in his last year at university as well
            as administrator and heir apparent to Capitán Tiago's wealth. Simoun
            reveals his motives to Basilio and offers him a place in his plans.
            Too secure of his place in the world, Basilio declines.

            - At Barrio Sagpang in the town of Tiani, Simoun stays at the house
            of the village's cabeza de barangay, Tales. Having suffered
            misfortune after misfortune in recent years, Kabesang Tales is
            unable to resist the temptation to steal Simoun's revolver and join
            the bandits. In Los Baños, Simoun joins his friend, the
            Captain-General, who is then taking a break from a hunting
            excursion. In a friendly game of cards with him and his cronies,
            Simoun raises the stakes higher and higher and half-jokingly secures
            blank orders for deportation, imprisonment, and summary execution
            from the Captain-General.

            - Later on, Simoun goes to Manila and meets Quiroga, a wealthy
            Chinese businessman and aspiring consul-general for the Chinese
            empire. Knowing Quiroga is heavily in his debt, Simoun offers him a
            steep discount if the former stores his massive arsenal of rifles in
            Quiroga's warehouses, to be used presumably for extortion activities
            with Manila's elite. Despite his hatred of guns and weaponry,
            Quiroga reluctantly agrees to do the job and uses his bazaar as a
            front.

            - During the Quiapo Fair, a talking heads exhibit ostensibly
            organized by an American named Mr. Leeds but secretly commissioned
            by Simoun is drawing popular acclaim. Padre Bernardo Salví, now
            chaplain of the Convent of the Poor Clares,attends one of the
            performances. The exhibit is set in Ptolemaic Egypt but features a
            tale that closely resembles that of Crisóstomo Ibarra and María
            Clara, and their fate under Salví. The show ends with an ominous vow
            of revenge. Deeply overcome with guilt and fear, Salví recommends
            the show be banned, but not before Mr. Leeds sailed for Hong Kong.

            - Months pass and the night of Simoun's revolution comes. Simoun
            visits Basilio in Tiago's house and tries to convince him again to
            join his revolution. He reveals his plan for the attack: a cannon
            volley shall be fired, at which point Kabesang Tales, now a bandit
            identifying himself as Matanglawin, and Simoun, who managed to
            deceive and recruit a sizable rogue force among the government
            troops, will lead their forces into the city. The leaders of the
            Church, the University, scores of bureaucrats, the Captain-General
            himself, as well as the bulk of officers guarding them are all
            conveniently located in one place, the theater where a controversial
            and much-hyped performance of Les cloches de Corneville is taking
            place. While Simoun and Matanglawin direct their forces, Basilio and
            several others are to raid the Convent of the Poor Clares and rescue
            María Clara.

            - However, Basilio reports to Simoun that María Clara died just that
            afternoon, after suffering the travails of monastic life under
            Salví, who always lusted after her. Simoun, driven by grief, aborts
            the attack and becomes crestfallen throughout the night. It will be
            reported later on that he suffered an "accident" that night, leaving
            him confined to his bed.

            - The following day, posters threatening violence to the leaders of
            the university and the government are found at the university doors.
            A reform-oriented student group to which Basilio belonged is named
            the primary suspects; the members are arrested, including Basilio,
            despite his absence from the group's mock dinner the night before.
            They are eventually freed through the intercession of relatives,
            except for Basilio who is an orphan and has no means to pay for his
            freedom. During his imprisonment, he learns that Capitán Tiago has
            died, leaving him with nothing; it is revealed that Tiago's will was
            actually forged by his spiritual advisor Padre Írene, who also
            supplied him with opium; his childhood sweetheart Juli has committed
            suicide to avoid getting raped by parish priest Camorra when she
            tried asking for help on Basilio's behalf; and that he has missed
            his graduation and will be required to study for another year, but
            now with no funds to go by. Released through the intercession of
            Simoun, a darkened, disillusioned Basilio joins Simoun's cause
            wholeheartedly.

            - Simoun, meanwhile, has been organizing a new revolution, and he
            reveals his plans to a now committed Basilio. The wedding of Juanito
            Peláez and Paulita Gómez will be used to coordinate the attack upon
            the city. As the Peláez and Gómez families are prominent members of
            the Manila elite, leaders of the church and civil government are
            invited to the reception. The Captain-General, who declined to
            extend his tenure despite Simoun's urging, is leaving in two days
            and is the guest of honor.

            - Simoun will personally deliver a pomegranate-shaped crystal lamp
            as a wedding gift. The lamp is to be placed on a plinth at the
            reception venue and will be bright enough to illuminate the entire
            hall, which was also walled with mirrors. After some time the light
            will flicker as if to go out. When someone attempts to raise the
            wick, a mechanism hidden within the lamp containing fulminated
            mercury will detonate, igniting the lamp which is actually filled
            with nitroglycerin, killing everyone in an enormous blast.

            - At the sound of the explosion, Simoun's mercenaries will attack,
            reinforced by Matanglawin and his bandits who will descend upon the
            city from the surrounding hills. Simoun postulates that in the
            chaos, the masses, already worked to a panic by the government's
            heavy-handed response to the poster incident, as well as rumors of
            German ships in the bay to lend their firepower to any uprising
            against the Spanish government, will step out in desperation to kill
            or be killed. Basilio and a few others are to put themselves at
            their head and lead them to Quiroga's warehouses, where Simoun's
            guns are still being kept. The plan thus finalized, Simoun gives
            Basilio a loaded revolver and sends him away to await further
            instructions.

            - Basilio walks the streets for hours and passes by his old home,
            Capitán Tiago's riverside house on Anloague Street. He discovers
            that this was to be the reception venue – Juanito Peláez's father
            bought Tiago's house as a gift for the newlywed couple. Sometime
            later, he sees Simoun enter the house with the lamp, then hastily
            exit the house and board his carriage. Basilio begins to move away
            but sees Isagani, his friend and Paulita Gómez's former lover, sadly
            looking at Paulita through the window. Noting how close they were to
            the condemned house, Basilio tries to head Isagani off, but Isagani
            was too dazed with grief to listen to him. In desperation, Basilio
            reveals to Isagani how the house is set to explode at any time then.
            But when Isagani still refuses to heed him, Basilio flees, leaving
            Isagani to his fate.

            - Seeing Basilio's demeanor, Isagani is belatedly unnerved by the
            revelation. Isagani rushes into the house, seizes the lamp, and
            throws it into the river. With this, Simoun's second revolution
            fails as well.

            torn down, sacks containing gunpowder are discovered hidden under
            the boards all over the house. Simoun, who had directed the
            renovations, is exposed. With the Captain-General having left for
            Spain, Simoun is left without his protector and is forced to flee. A
            manhunt ensues and Simoun is chased as far away as the shores of the
            Pacific. He then spends the rest of his days hiding in the ancestral
            mansion of Padre Florentino, Isagani's uncle.

            - One day, the lieutenant of the local Guardia Civil informs
            Florentino that he received an order to arrest Simoun that night. In
            response, Simoun drinks the slow-acting poison which he always kept
            in a compartment in his treasure chest. Simoun then makes his final
            confession to Florentino, first revealing his true name, to
            Florentino's shock. He goes on to narrate how thirteen years before,
            as Crisóstomo Ibarra, he lost everything in the Philippines despite
            his good intentions. Crisóstomo swore vengeance. Retrieving some of
            his family's treasure that Elias had buried in the Ibarra mausoleum
            in the forest, Crisóstomo fled to foreign lands and engaged in
            trade. He took part in the war in Cuba, aiding first one side and
            then another, but always profiting. There Crisóstomo met the
            Captain-General who was then a major, whose goodwill he won first by
            loans of money, and afterwards by covering his criminal activity.
            Crisóstomo bribed his way to secure the major's promotion to
            Captain-General and his assignment to the Philippines. Once in the
            country, Crisóstomo then used him as a blind tool and invited him to
            all kinds of injustice, taking advantage of the Captain-General's
            insatiable lust for gold.

            - The confession is long and arduous, and night has fallen when
            Crisóstomo finishes. In the end, Florentino assures the dying man of
            God's mercy, but explains that his revolution failed because he has
            chosen means that God cannot sanction. Crisóstomo bitterly accepts
            the explanation and dies.

            - Realizing that the arresting officers will confiscate Crisóstomo's
            possessions, Florentino divests him of his jewels and casts them
            into the sea, proclaiming that they are best hidden under the waters
            for the time being to ensure that they cannot be used to distort
            justice or incite greed, and that God shall provide the means to
            draw them out should people need wealth for a righteous cause.

            Father Florentino – Isagani's uncle and a retired priest. Florentino
            was the son of a wealthy and influential Manila family. At his
            influential mother's insistence, he broke off an affair with his
            sweetheart and entered the priesthood, devoting himself to his
            parish. An indio (native), Florentino was a secular priest, one
            unaffiliated with the Catholic religious orders, yet his parish drew
            in huge income. When the 1872 Cavite mutiny broke out, he promptly
            resigned from priesthood, fearing unwanted attention. He retired to
            his family's large estate along the shores of the Pacific. He is
            described as white-haired, with a quiet, serene personality and a
            strong build. He did not smoke or drink. He was well respected by
            his peers, even by Spanish friars and officials.

            Father Fernández – a Dominican who was a friend of Isagani.
            Following the incident with the posters, he invited Isagani to a
            dialogue, not so much as a teacher with his student but as a friar
            with a Filipino. Although they failed to resolve their differences,
            they each promised to approach their colleagues with the opposing
            views from the other party – although both feared that given the
            animosity that existed between their sides, their own compatriots
            may not believe in the other party's existence.

            Capitán Tiago – Don Santiago de los Santos. María Clara's father.
            Having several landholdings in Pampanga, Binondo, and Laguna, as
            well as taking ownership of the Ibarras' vast estate, Tiago still
            fell into depression following María's entry into the convent. He
            alleviated this by smoking opium, which quickly became an
            uncontrolled vice, exacerbated by his association with Padre Írene
            who regularly supplied him with the substance. Tiago hired Basilio
            as a capista, a servant who was given the opportunity to study as
            part of his wages; Basilio eventually pursued medicine and became
            his caregiver and the manager of his estate. Tiago died of shock
            upon hearing of Basilio's arrest and Padre Írene's embellished
            stories of violent revolt.

            Captain-General – the highest-ranking official in the Philippines
            during the Spanish colonial period. The Captain-General in the novel
            is Simoun's friend and confidant, and is described as having an
            insatiable lust for gold. Simoun met him as a major during the Ten
            Years' War in Cuba. He secured the major's friendship and promotion
            to Captain-General through bribes. When he was posted in the
            Philippines, Simoun used him as a pawn in his own power plays to
            drive the country into revolution. The Captain-General was shamed
            into not extending his tenure after being rebuked by a high official
            in the aftermath of Basilio's imprisonment.

            protect their prerogatives as monopolizers of instruction. Some of

            Peninsular Spaniard portrayed as an opportunist who married his way
            into high society, who regularly criticized favored ideas that did
            not come from him, but was ultimately, laughably incompetent.

            Kabesang Tales – Telesforo Juan de Dios, a former cabeza de barangay
            of Barrio Sagpang in Tiani. He was a sugarcane planter who cleared
            lands he thought belonged to no one, losing his wife and eldest
            daughter in the endeavor. When the Dominicans took over his farm, he
            fought to his last money to have it retained in his possession.
            While his suit against the Dominicans was ongoing, he was kidnapped
            by bandits while he was out patrolling his fields. Having no money
            to pay his captors, his daughter Juli was forced to become a maid in
            exchange for her mistress paying his ransom. When his son Tano was
            conscripted into the Guardia Civil, again Tales had no money to pay
            for Tano's exclusion from the draft. When in spite of all Tales lost
            the case, he not only lost his farm but was also dealt with a heavy
            fine. He later joined the bandits and became one of their fiercest
            commanders. Tandang Selo, his father, would later on join his band
            after the death of Juli.

            On Christmas Day, when Juli left to be with her mistress, Selo
            suffered some form of stroke that impaired his ability to speak.
            After Juli's suicide, Selo left town permanently, taking with him
            his hunting spear. He was later seen with the bandits and was killed
            in an encounter with the Guardia Civil – ironically by the gun of
            the troops' sharpshooter Tano, his grandson.

            was reorganized. The organization decided to declare its support for
            La Solidaridad and the reforms it advocated, raise funds for the
            paper, and defray the expenses of deputies advocating reforms for
            the country before the Spanish Cortes. Eventually after some
            disarray in the leadership of the group, the Supreme Council of the
            League dissolved the society.

            - Liga membership split into two groups when it was about to be
            revealed: the conservatives formed the Cuerpo de Compromisarios
            which pledged to continue supporting the La Solidaridad while the
            radicals led by Bonifacio devoted themselves to a new and secret
            society, the Katipunan.

            - Jose Rizal's arrival in Manila on June 26, 1892 had become very
            sensational among the Filipinos. His popularity feared the
            Spaniards, and as such, paid careful attention to his every moves –
            all houses where he had been were searched and the Filipinos seen in
            his company were suspected. As he had planned, on July 3, 1892 he
            founded the La Liga Filipina in the house of Doroteo Ongjunco in
            Tondo, Manila.

            - Aboard the steamer Cebu and under heavy guard, Rizal left Manila,
            sailing to Mindoro and Panay, until he reached Dapitan at seven
            o'clock in the evening of June 17. From that day until July 31,
            1896, Dapitan became the bare witness to one of the most fruitful
            periods in Rizal's life. His stay in the province was more than “he”
            living in exile – it was the period when Rizal had been more focused
            on serving the people and the society through his civic works,
            medical practices, land development and promotion of education.

            - In Dapitan, Rizal had a scholarly debate with Father Pablo
            Pastells regarding religion. This exchange of heated arguments
            revealed the anti-Christian Rizal – his bitterness on the abuses
            performed by friars, doing such under the name of the sacred
            religion. Father Pastells tried his best to win Rizal back to the
            faith but fortunately or unfortunately, in vain. These series of
            debate ended inconclusively in which neither of them convinced the
            other of his judgments/arguments.

            - Rizal had maximized his stay in Dapitan by devoting much of his
            time in improving his artistic and literary skills; doing
            agricultural and civic projects; engaging in business activities,
            and writing letters to his friends in Europe, particularly to
            Ferdinand Blumentritt and Reinhold Rost. His careers and
            achievements in different fields were as follows:

            - As a physician, Rizal provided free medicine to his patients, most
            of them were underprivileged. However, he also had wealthy patients
            who paid him well enough for his excellent surgical skill. Among
            them were Don Ignacio Tumarong who gave Rizal 3000 pesos for
            restoring his sight, an Englishman who gave him 500 pesos, and
            Aklanon haciendero, DonFrancisco Azcarraga, who paid him a cargo of
            sugar. His skill was put into test in August 1893 when his mother,
            Doña Teodora Alonzo, was placed under ophthalmic surgery for the
            third time. The operation was a success, however, Alonzo ignored her
            son's instructions and removed the bandages in her eyes which lead
            to irritation and infection.

            - As an engineer, Rizal applied his knowledge through the waterworks
            system he constructed in Dapitan. Going back to his academic life,
            Rizal obtained the title of expert surveyor (perito agrimensor) from
            the Ateneo Municipal. From his practical knowledge as an agrimensor,
            he widened his knowledge by reading engineering-related books. As a
            result, despite the inadequacy of tools at hand, he successfully
            provided a good water system in the province.

            - As an educator, Rizal established a school in Dapitan which was
            attended by 16 young boys from prominent families. Instead of
            charging them for the matriculation, he made the students do
            community projects for him like maintaining his garden and field. He
            taught them reading, writing in English and Spanish, geography,
            history, mathematics, industrial work, nature study, morals and
            gymnastics. He encouraged his students to engage in sports
            activities to strengthen their bodies as well. There was no formal
            room, like the typical classroom nowadays. Classes were conducted
            from 2 p.m to 4 p.m. with the teacher sitting on a hammock while the
            students sat on a long bamboo bench.

            - As an agriculturist, Rizal devoted time in planting important
            crops and fruit-bearing trees in his 16-hectare land (later,
            reaching as large as 70 hectares). He planted cacao,
            coffee,sugarcane, and coconuts, among many others. He even invested
            part of his earnings from being a medical practitioner and his
            6000-peso winnings from a lottery on lands. From the United States,
            he imported agricultural machinery and introduced to the native
            farmers of Dapitan the modern agricultural methods. Rizal also
            visualized having an agricultural colony in Sitio Ponot, within the
            Sindañgan Bay. He believed that the area was suitable for
            cattle-raising and for cash-crops as the area had abundant water.
            Unfortunately, this plan did not materialize.

            - As a businessman, the adventurous Rizal, with his partner, Ramon
            Carreon, tried his luck in the fishing, hemp and copra industries.
            In a letter to his brother-in-law, Manuel T. Hidalgo, he pointed out
            the potential of the fishing industry in the province (as the area
            was abundant with fish and good beaches). He also requested that two
            good Calamba fishermen be sent to Dapitan to teach the fisher folks
            of the new fishing methods, using a big net called pukutan. But the
            industry in which Rizal became more successful was in hemp, shipping
            the said product to a foreign firm in Manila.

            - As an inventor, little was known of Rizal. In 1887, during his
            medical practice in Calamba, he invented a special type of lighter
            called sulpukan which he sent to Blumentritt as a gift. According to
            Rizal, the wooden lighter's mechanism was based on the principle of
            compressed air. Another of his inventions was the wooden brick-maker
            can manufacture about 6,000 bricks a day.

            - As an artist, he had contributed his talent to the Sisters of
            Charity who were preparing for the arrival of the image of the Holy
            Virgin. Rizal was actually the person who modeled the image's right
            foot and other details. He also conceptualized its curtain, which
            was oil-painted by a Sister under his instruction. He also made
            sketches of anything which attracted him in Dapitan. Among his
            collections were the three rare fauna species that he discovered
            (dragon/lizard, frog and beetle) and the fishes he caught. He also
            sculpted the statuette called “The Mother's Revenge” which
            represented his dog, Syria, avenging her puppy to a crocodile which
            killed it.

            - As a linguist, Rizal was interested in the languages used in
            Dapitan, thus, studied and made comparisons of the Bisayan and
            Malayan languages existing in the region. In fact, Rizal had
            knowledge in 22 languages: Tagalog, Ilocano, Bisayan, Subanun,
            Spanish, Latin, Greek, English, French, German, Arabic, Malayan,
            Hebrew, Sanskrit, Dutch, Catalan, Italian, Chinese, Japanes,
            Portuguese, Swedish and Russian.

            - As a scientist, Rizal shared his interest with nature to his
            students. With his boys, they explored the jungles and searched for
            specimens which he sent to museums in Europe, particularly in the
            Dressed Museum. In return, scientific books and surgical instruments
            were delivered to him from the European scientists. He also did a
            bulk of other research and studies in the fields of ethnography,
            archaeology, geology, anthropology and geography. However, Rizal's
            most significant contribution in the scientific world was his
            discovery of three species:

            the province, he noticed its poor condition. He drained the marshes
            of Dapitan to get rid of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. He also
            provided lighting systems coconut oil lamps posted in dark streets
            in the province out of what he earned from being a physician. He
            beautified Dapitan by remodeling the town plaza, with the aid of his
            Jesuit teacher, Fr. Francisco Sanchez, and created a relief map of
            Mindanao (footnote: using stones, soil and grass) right in front of
            the church.

            Orlac. Rizal's fame as an ophthalmic surgeon reached overseas, and
            one of Rizal's friends, Julio Llorente referred the group to Rizal.
            Rizal and Bracken instantly fell in love with each and in just one
            month, they agreed to marry which appalled and disturbed Taufer.
            However, the parish priest of Dapitan, Father Pedro Obach, refused
            to do so unless they were permitted by the Bishop of Cebu.

            no priest was willing to marry the two, the couple exchanged their
            vows before God in their own way, which scandalized Fr. Obach. In
            1896, their love bore its fruit – Josephine was pregnant.
            Unfortunately, Bracken gave birth to a one-month premature baby boy
            who lived only for three hours. The child was buried in Dapitan,
            bearing the name Francisco, after Rizal's father.

            - Prior to the outbreak of the revolution, the Katipunan leader,
            Andres Bonifacio, sought the advice of Jose Rizal. In a secret
            meeting on May 2, 1896 at Bitukang Manok river in Pasig, the group
            agreed to send Dr. Pio Valenzuela as a representative to Dapitan who
            will inform Rizal of their plan to launch a revolution against the
            Spaniards. On board the steamer Venus, Valenzuala left Manila on
            June 15, 1892 and in 6 days, arrived at Dapitan with a blind
            companion, Raymundo Mata. At night, Rizal and Valenzuela had a talk
            in the former's garden. There, Valenzuela told him of the
            Katipunan's plan. Regarding this, Rizal outspokenly objected

            During the peak of the Cuban revolution, Rizal offered his services
            as a military doctor to compromise with the shortage of physicians
            in the said country. It was his friend Ferdinand Blumentritt who
            informed him of the situation in Cuba and suggested that he
            volunteer himself as army doctor. On December 17, 1895, Rizal sent a
            letter to Governor General Ramon Blanco rendering his service for
            Cuba. But for months Rizal waited in vain for the governor's reply,
            and lost hope that his request would be granted. It was only on July
            30, 1896 when Rizal received a letter from Governor Blanco, dated
            July 2, 1896, accepting his offer. The letter also stated that Rizal
            will be given a pass so that he can go to Manila, then to Spain

            ophthalmic operation to a merchant who paid him fifty silver pesos.
            After almost a week, on August 6, 1896, España arrived in Manila.
            Rizal was supposed to board the Isla de Luzon for Spain, but
            unfortunately, left ahead of time. Instead, he was transferred to
            the Spanish cruiser Castilla to stay and wait for the next mail boat
            that would sail for Spain next month. He was prohibited from leaving
            the vicinity but was allowed to accept visitors so long as they were
            his immediate family. Of course, all these delays were part of the
            drama – Rizal has now fallen to the critical/deadly Spanish trap.

            in 1752. He was assisted by Fr. Francisco Paula de Sanchez, S.J.,
            his favorite teacher at the Ateneo de Manila where he studied in
            1872-1877. Rizal used this map as a motivating device in teaching
            geography and history to his pupils during his lonely but productive
            banishment in Dapitan from July 17, 1892 to July 31, 1896.

            disturbance in Manila. On September 3, 1896, Rizal boarded Isla de
            Panay and sailed to Singapore. Some of his companions like Manuel
            Camus persuaded Rizal to stay in Singapore to avoid possible arrest
            in Spain due to the outbreak of the revolution.

            Rizal was illegally detained aboard the Colon. The judge in
            Singapore, Sir Lionel Cox, ruled that the Spanish vessel was a ship
            of war and that the laws of the British Empire who controlled the
            island colonies cannot apply there. On November 3, he arrived in
            Manila. & The Trial Upon his arrival, the civil guards brought and
            escorted him to Fort Santiago on orders that he would be detained
            there and held incommunicado. & On November 20, 1896, Rizal was
            brought before a Spanish military tribunal headed by Colonel

            last remaining days, composed his longest poem Mi ultimo adios,
            which was about his farewell to the Filipino people.

            - Rizal also told his sisters to look inside his shoes after he was
            executed. At 5 am, Rizal had his last breakfast and autographed his
            remaining books that became his last souvenirs. Afterwards, he wrote
            3 farewell letters to his parents, Dr. Bluementritt, and his older
            brother Paciano. At 6:30 in the morning of December 30, 1896, Rizal
            in a black suit with his arm tied behind his back, walked to
            Bagumbayan.

            - Rizal requested to spare his head which was granted. He also
            requested to be shot in the front but was denied. Dr. Felipe Ruiz
            Castillo took his pulse and found out that it was normal. The orders
            were given and shots were fired. Consummatum Est! (“It is
            Finished!”) Rizal died offering his life for his country and its
            freedom.

            - The Spanish spectator shouted “Viva España!”. Rizal’s body was
            secretly buried at Paco Cemetery where it was later traced by his
            sister. The remains of Rizal were cleaned in Higino Mercado’s house
            in Binondo and were later given to Doña Teodora. His remains were
            laid to rest inside the monument in Luneta. Not all are buried,
            Rizal’s vertebra is in Rizal Shrine.

            - Mi último adiós (English: "My Last Farewell") is a poem written by
            Filipino propagandist and writer Dr. José Rizal before his execution
            by firing squad on December 30, 1896. The piece was one of the last
            notes he wrote before his death. Another that he had written was
            found in his shoe, but because the text was illegible, its contents
            remain a mystery.

            - Rizal did not ascribe a title to his poem. Mariano Ponce, his
            friend and fellow reformist, titled it "Mi último pensamiento" ("My
            Last Thought") in the copies he distributed, but this did not catch
            on. Also, the "coconut oil lamp" containing the poem was not
            delivered to the Rizal's family until after the execution as it was
            required to light the cell.

            - "On the afternoon of Dec. 29, 1896, a day before his execution,
            Dr. José Rizal was visited by his mother, Teodora Alonzo; sisters
            Lucia, Josefa, Trinidád, Maria and Narcisa; and two nephews. When
            they took their leave, Rizal told Trinidád in English that there was
            something in the small alcohol stove (cocinilla), as opposed to
            saying coconut oil lamp (lamparilla), which was intended to provide
            cover for the transportation of the text. The stove was given to
            Narcisa by the guard when the party was about to board their
            carriage in the courtyard. At home, the Rizal ladies recovered a
            folded paper from the stove. On it was written an unsigned, untitled
            and undated poem of 14 five-line stanzas. The Rizals reproduced
            copies of the poem and sent them to Rizal's friends in the country
            and abroad. In 1897, Mariano Ponce in Hong Kong had the poem printed
            with the title "Mí último pensamiento". Fr. Mariano Dacanay, who
            received a copy of the poem while a prisoner in Bilibid (jail),
            published it in the first issue of La Independencia on September 25,
            1898 with the title 'Ultimo Adios'.
