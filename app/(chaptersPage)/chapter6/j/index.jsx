            The essay "Veneration Without Understanding" by Renato Constantino
            is viewed tounderstand how the historian utilized a Marxist
            framework to eventually build his own interpretation of the national
            hero, Jose Rizal. This has changed my perspective on thedifference
            between reform and revolution. It clarifies how these two approaches
            shaped Spanishcolonization. The changes proposed by Rizal for the
            Philippines were unable to provide Filipinoswith the desired freedom
            and independence. While revolution is the most appropriate way
            toliberate oneself from oppression.

            The article mostly discussed Filipinos adoration or veneration of
            Rizal without delvingfurther into it. This post revealed the source
            of Filipinos' admiration for Rizal and how they havea mistaken sense
            of identity for him. Students were taught from an early age that
            Jose Rizalwas the catalyst for the revolution. Through his writings,
            he instilled in Filipinos a feeling ofnationalism, making him the
            most beloved national hero. Rizal, ironically, opposed
            therevolution. Another problem is that Americans have declared Rizal
            to be a national hero of thePhilippines in order to match with their
            propaganda. Nonetheless, the role of heroes influencedthe nation's
            mindset.

            The great Plutarch, called “The Divine” by ancient and modern
            writers, wrote a book entitled Parallel Lives during the first
            century of Christianity. The parsonages he used, inorder to
            accomplish his objective of comparison and contrast, were a Roman
            and a Greek each time, as Cicero and Demosthenes, Numa Pompilius and
            Lycurgus, Fabius and Pericles, Cato and Aristides.

            This discussion is an analysis in the manner of Plutarch regarding
            the prominent and important events and documentary evidence that may
            be used as a basis for contrasts between two Filipinos who were
            different, not in thought and opinion, but in belief concerning the
            accomplishment of our revolution against Spain: Rizal and Bonifacio,
            the first having founded the evolutionist Liga Filipina, and the
            second the revolutionist Katipunan, which succeeded the Liga
            Filipina.

        <View className="flex-row space-x-2 ml-4">
          <Text>
            Cesar Majul's "Maria Clara's Locket" examines the metaphorical
            meaning of Maria Clara in José Rizal's Noli Me Tangere, specifically
            her function in colonial-era Philippine culture. The delicate
            balance between individual freedom and the social norms enforced by
            the colonial state is symbolized by the locket, which is associated
            with Maria Clara's identity and purity. Majul highlights the link
            between Maria Clara's tragedy and the larger struggle for Filipino
            identity and liberty by examining how this emblem represents the
            loss of innocence and the emotional hardships endured under Spanish
            rule.

            The study also explores the locket's religious and cultural
            significance as a bridge connecting indigenous customs and colonial
            legacy. Majul contends that the internal fight Maria Clara has
            between duty, sacrifice, and love is a reflection of the Philippine
            people's struggle under foreign rule. According to the story,
            comprehending her position sheds light on the intricacies of
            national identity during the emergence of Filipino consciousness.
