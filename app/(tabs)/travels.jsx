            and things on board the steamer. There were sixteen passengers. He
            was the only Filipino and the rest were Spaniards, British, and
            Indian Negroes. The captain of the ship, Donato Lecha befriended
            Rizal. To kill boredom of the voyage, Rizal played chess with his
            fellow passengers. He then defeated them many times, for he was a
            good chess player.

            After days of staying in Singapore, Rizal boarded the ship Djemnah,
            which was a French steamer and left Singapore for Europe on May 11.
            It was a larger and cleaner vessel which carried more passengers.
            French was spoken on board and Rizal attempted to converse with his
            fellow passengers in French, but he found out that his book French
            could not be understood, so he spoke a mixed Spanish-Latin and with
            the help sketching on paper. By conversing daily with the French
            passengers, he then was able to improve his knowledge of the French
            language.

            On May 17, the Djemnah reached Point Galle, a seacoast town in
            southern Ceylon. Rizal was unimpressed by this town. The following
            day the voyage resumed towards Colombo, the capital of Ceylon. After
            a few hours of sailing, Rizal reached the city. Rizal was amazed by
            Colombo because of this scenic beauty and elegant building.

            sightseeing. What impressed him most was the beautiful moonlight
            which reminded him of Calamba and his family.

            The Djemnah took five days to traverse the Suez Canal. Rizal was
            thrilled because it was his first trip through this canal which was
            build by Ferdinand de Lasseps. At Port Said, Rizal landed in order
            to see the interesting sights. He was fascinated to hear
            multi-racial inhabitants speaking a wide variety of language.

            Rizal reached Naples. This city pleased Rizal because of its
            business activity, its lively people and its scenic beauty. He was
            fascinated by the Mouth Vesuvius, the Castle of ST. Telmo and other
            historic sights of the city.

            On June 1883, Rizal left Madrid to visit Paris. He stayed at the
            Hotel de Paris but then moved to a cheaper hotel. Like all tourists,
            Rizal was charmingly titillated by the attractive scenery of Paris
            such as the beautiful boulevards, the Opera House, the Place de la
            Concorde, the Arch of Triumph, the Bois de Boulogne, the Madelaine
            Church, the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the Column of Vendome, the
            Invalides, and the Versailes. Rizal closely observed the French way
            of life and spending many hours at the museums.

            In Spain, he became close with prominent Spanish liberal and
            republican Spaniards, who were mostly Masons. Rizal was impressed by
            the way the Spanish Masons openly and freely criticized the
            government policies and lambasted the friars. In March 1883, he
            joined the Masonic lodge called Acacia in Madrid. His reason for
            joining was to secure Freemasonry’s aid in his fight against the
            friars in the Philippines. Later he was transferred to Lodge
            Solidaridad where he became a Master Mason on November 15, 1890.
            Still later, he was awarded the diploma as Master Mason by Le Grand
            Orient de France in Paris.

            Germany famous for its old university and romantic surroundings. He
            lived in a boarding house with some German law students. The German
            students found out that Rizal was a good chess player and made him a
            member of the Chess Player’s Club. After a few days, he was
            transferred to a boarding house which was near University of
            Heidelberg. He worked at the University Eye Hospital under the

            because he was interested in botany. They visited Dr. Adolph B.
            Meyer, who was overjoyed to see them. They also visited the Museum
            of Art and Rizal was deeply impressed by the painting of “Prometheus

            scientific and the absence of race prejudice. Also, here he met Dr.
            Feodor Jagor author of Travels in the Philippines, a book that Rizal
            admired because of its keen observances in the Philippine setting.
            Dr. Jagor in turn, introduced Rizal to Dr. Rudolf Virchow, a famous
            anthropologist and to his son, Dr. Hans Virchow, professor of
            Descriptive Anatomy. Rizal worked in the clinic of Dr. Karl Ernest

            On May 24, Rizal and Viola left Vienna on a river boat to see the
            beautiful sights of the Danube Rivera. As they both travel with
            boat, Rizal observed the different sights like the barges loaded
            with products, the flowers and plants growing along the river banks,
            the boats with families living on them, and the quaint villages on
            the riversides. They also noticed that the passengers were using
            paper napkins during meals.

            The river voyage ended in Lintz. They traveled overland to Salzburg
            and from there to Munich where they sojourned for a short time to
            savor the famous Munich beer, reputed to be the best in Germany.

            On February 3, 1888, after six months of stay in Calamba, Rizal left
            Manila for Hong Kong on board the Zafiro. He was sad and sick during
            the crossing of the choppy China Sea. He did not get off the ship
            when it made a stopover at Amoy, because he was sick, it was raining
            and the city was dirty. He arrived in Hong Kong on February 8.

            In Hong Kong, Rizal stayed at Victoria Hotel. He was welcomed by the
            Filipino community in Hong Kong. During this time, a Spaniard, Jose
            Varanda, was shadowing Rizal’s movements in Hong Kong. It is
            believed that he was ordered to spy on Rizal.

            American steamer and his destination was Japan. Rizal did not like
            the meals on board but liked the ship because it was clean and
            efficiently managed.

            Among the happiest moments of Rizal in his life was his sojourn in
            the Land of the Cherry Blossoms. He stayed in Japan for one month
            and a half from February 28 to April 13, 1888. He was charmed by the
            natural beauty of Japan, the manners of the Japanese people and the
            picturesque of shrines. He also fell in love with a Japanese girl,
            who loveliness infused joy and romance in his sorrowing heart.

            Rizal was greatly impressed by Japan. Among of which are the natural
            beauty of the country, the cleanliness and politeness of the people,
            the picturesque dress and simple charm of the Japanese women, there
            were few thieves in Japan, and beggars were rarely seen in the city
            streets. However, he disliked the rickshaws drawn by men.

            The steamer Belgic docked at the San Francisco on Saturday morning,
            April 28, 1888. All passengers were not allowed to land. The
            American health authorities placed the ship under quarantine on the
            ground it came from the Far east where a cholera epidemic was
            alleged to be raging. Rizal was surprised because he knew there was
            no Cholera epidemic at that time. He joined other passengers
            protesting the unjustifiable action of the health authorities.
            Later, the American consul in Japan had given the ship a clean bill
            of health.

            at the home of Dr. Antonio Ma. Regidor– a lawyer in London. By the
            end of May he was a boarder of the Beckett family. His home was
            located near public parks and within easy walking distance to the
            British Museum. He spent most of his time in the British Museum
            studying the book of Morga’s Sucesos and other rare historical books
            about the Philippines.

            born. Rizal received from Mrs. Beckett a book entitled The Life and
            Adventures of Valentine Vox, the Ventriloquist.

            house.

            found out that F. Meyer-Van Loo Press was willing to print his book
            on installment basis. He pawned all his jewels to pay the down
            payment and early partial payments. He had received money from Basa
            and 200 pesos from Arias for the copies of Morga’s Sucesos which
            were sold in Manila.
